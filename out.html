<h2>To dodge the submerged iceberg of industrial-scale food production and its side effects, to alter the course of this country and reinvigorate the economy, all I need to do is make you more interested in food. In total, we need to make 20 million people more aware of eating. This will lead to changes, starting with breakfast. Then the snowball of consonant decisions takes care of the rest. Stranger things have happened. [Timothy Ferriss]</h2>

        <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
        <p>"Hi.." waved Aris at the armed thugs with one hand, holding his knife in the other. Noticing now, these were
            not ordinary thugs. Instead, they seemed like a group of dozen well organised pirates. And now this troupe
            was aiming all their weaponry in Aris's direction, with his only shield being his younger sister standing in
            front of him.</p>
        <p>"Well, why don't you put down that measly knife, I think you might just be outnumbered here." spoke the gray
            haired man in front. From the dynamics that Aris could read, this was the captain of this squad. The man
            wore a dark gray jacket, slicked back hair and a short, pointed stubble. He stood tall, with an ominous tone
            in his voice, as he invited Aris in. The young pearl diver still stood his ground. He did not expect to win
            a direct confrontation, but perhaps he could pull off the pearl trick that he did a few days ago. That
            one seemed to work.</p>
        <p>"I implore you to sit down with us, perhaps you can make your case for why we should not end your lives right
            where you stand. Don't get me wrong, I <em>despise</em> hurting children," the man looked at Kori briefly
            before continuing, "but you've really found us at an unfortunate time. Well, unfortunate for you that is."
        </p>
        <p>Aris was in the midst of planning the escape, when he heard heavy steps downstairs that eventually came up
            and emerged behind him. A man, as tall as a mountain and twice that wide, with a curled mustache
            and bald head suddenly stood right behind them. Looking back briefly, Aris saw that the man was wearing a
            dark leather jacket that covered his bare chest, painted with various tattoos.</p>
        <p>"That there is my friend and colleague, Vas. I've seen him break men twice your size as if they were but a
            cracked plank. Now please, again, I insist on you joining us." spoke the gray man with surprising eloquence.
        </p>
        <p>Aris, ready to go out in a fight of glory, looked at Korina, now genuine fear in her eyes.</p>
        <p>"Okay! But promise not to hurt her!" Aris said, and raised both of his hands halfway up, still holding his
            knife with his thumb in an open palm.
            <br>"I am not in a position to make such promises, but I assure you we will seek the most pacifistic solution to
            this conundrum that we can." finished the captain.</p>
        <p>As he spoke the final words, Aris felt a strong rush and suddenly he was disarmed, owing to the hunky man
            behind him. Now that he was closer up, Aris noted that Vas was two heads taller than him. Their fight would
            not have ended well.</p>
        <p>"Very well." said the captain and motioned to the centre of the group. From what Aris gathered, the group has
            made a small campfire and brought up all the supplies from the kitchen as they camped up here on the deck of
            the fallen apart ship. Kori must've disturbed them in the middle of a thrilling card game, judging from the
            knives and cards present on a table, positioned near the campfire. The entire setup was located just under
            the wheel of the ship.</p>
        <p>Korina and Aris sat down on one of the benches, sitting opposite the captain. Vas sat down beside them and
            gave them an unexpected smile. He is a complete psychopath and will skin me alive and wear me as a hat,
            laughed Aris in his head.</p>
        <p>"Sorry for such a rushed invitation, but your presence here was rather unforeseen. My name is Yiannis, and
            I'm the captain. Not of this ship of course, mine is a bit more functional" he spoke.</p>
        <p>"So why are you here and not on your "functional" ship then?" asked Kori, which took Aris by surprise.
            <br>"Ah, you'd like to know why we're camping out here within the wreckage, rather than sleeping in our comfy
            beds back on our ship, wouldn't you darling?" answered Yiannis and knelt down towards her.
            <br>"Well, simply put we're a.., let's say private contractors tasked with recovering certain valuable cargo.
            Now this cargo is very important to us, if you understand me. And we can't let two young scavengers like you
            and your compatriot there steal it from under us." he continued.</p>
        <p>"Captain, I think the little girl is asking why we haven't just taken what we came for and left." spoke a
            younger blonde woman sitting by the fire. Aris looked at the pirate in surprise. He was not sure questioning
            the commander was something allowed, so he waited for a reaction, watching the woman meanwhile. She was
            wearing a white loosely collared shirt, held up together by a dark flowery corset. Her blonde hair flowed
            freely right to her shoulders and her face had a touch of kindness to it. She had piercing blue eyes that
            left a heavy effect on Aris. </p>
        <p>"Ah, Eliza, perhaps you could answer the question you so eloquently put." he turned to her and then back to
            Korina. "<em>Why exactly</em> have we decided to stay the night here, when we have already got everything we
            came for?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Because the boys found quite a considerable amount of alcohol in the lower deck?" she said.</p>
        <p>He nodded. "Exactly, because the boys found quite an considerable amount of alcohol gods know where. So now
            we're camping out on this forsaken place. Isn't it <em>fun</em>?" he said, with an annoyed intonation in his
            voice. </p>
        <p>Korina now started to become a bit less uncomfortable with the group. They were baddies, probably murderers,
            but they were not particularly unkind to her or her brother. </p>
        <p>"So, now that we told you our reasons for staying in this wretched place, what are your reasons for walking
            in on us? Do you have a death wish?" asked an older, scruffy man sitting beside the blonde woman. Aris
            noticed he bore a striking resemblance to her. Probably a brother, always nice to see another sibling
            relationship.</p>
        <p>"He, my brother was chasing me..." answered Kori to the group. Aris could almost die from embarrassment as
            the group exploded into laughter. Especially hearty was the laugh coming from behind them, from the man the
            captain called Vas.</p>
        <p>Finally regaining some composure, Yiannis asked, "Chasing, huh? Do you two often make a point of playing
            around in abandoned wrecks full of death and destruction?"</p>
        <p>"Well, our village was raided and we barely escaped by the skin of our necks.." started to answer Kori
            promptly, before being nudged by Aris to stop talking. He decided to take the helm of the conversation and
            steer it in a better direction. </p>
        <p>"We have come here to look for survivors. I don't presume you've found any, or at least have left any alive?"
            he asked.</p>
        <p>"Survivors then? I don't think we have seen any, have we?" said Yiannis and looked around to his crowd.
            <br>"No, captain, we have not," answered the scruffy man, "it's a total mystery where they've all gone."</p>
        <p>Looking at the man, Aris studied his long dark hair and a full unkept beard. Even from the brief interaction,
            Aris gathered that the man was a master of his own element, confident in his stance and most probably the
            right hand of Yiannis himself. He also seemed to have an impressive rapier tucked in a sheath behind his
            belt. The man wore a dark leather cloak with a small bandolier underneath it, filled with bullets ready for
            take out. </p>
        <p>"See? No survivors then. Now the question arises, what to do with you two." said the captain.
            <br>"Perhaps you could just let us go, so we can tell everyone we meet how scary you were?" suggested Korina.
        </p>
        <p>"No, I think that won't do," he chuckled and after a while of thinking continued, "but I do have an offer for
            you. It's quite simple really. We can either shoot you right where you're standing, which I'm not a fan of,
            frankly. Or we can allow you to make yourselves useful on our ship, mostly by assisting with tasks Eliza
            here has grown annoyed with." he said and nodded to the young woman. </p>
        <p>The siblings looked at each other.</p>
        <p>"So, which one will it be?"</p>

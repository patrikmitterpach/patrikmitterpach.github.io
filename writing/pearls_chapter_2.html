        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
        <p>Aris stared intently into the mirror hung up in his bathroom. The six-foot tall young man, with unshaven
            stubble and curly dark brown hair gave himself an encouraging smile, washed up his face and returned
            downstairs to the living room of his adoptive parents.</p>
        <p>They were a nice couple, somewhere in their sixties, Aris imagined. He never thought to ask. Since they could
            not have children of their own, the Zarvalisses adopted or took care of everyone who showed up to the
            village. One such child was Aris. Nobody was quite sure where he came from, but one day the locals found him
            wondering around the town, carrying just a small pocket knife. He himself could not remember much, he
            couldn't have been older than six years of age. Zarvalisses took him in and he's been with them ever since.
        </p>
        <p>Aris sat behind the table and picked up a piece of bread, left over from the lunch. Andreas Zarvaliss, the
            patriarch of the house sat opposite him, just finishing his afternoon wine. </p>
        <p>"Caught anything good?" asked Andreas. The family wasn't quite dependent on Aris, but any profits of his
            would be shared with the household, that was the tradition. Usually the bigger catches warranted a proper
            celebration, but there's been fewer and fewer of those in the past few years.
            Aris just shook his head. He never shared his scheme, his endeavors not even with the closer members of what
            was now his family. Mindless gossips would become the death of his retirement plan. Most people around knew
            him as the worst diver in the town and Aris wasn't too keen on proving them otherwise.</p>
        <p>"Perhaps the guys at the docks could teach you how to actually do your job, I've seen them today hammering
            down the latest catches" exclaimed Andreas.
            "Those brutes? Like little children banging rocks against each other, that's what you want for me?" replied
            Aris.
            "Look, to be honest, I don't think you're just that skilled as pearl catching. I've seen ten year old boys
            bring back more loot than you do. Maybe you could go for a different career, it might actually do you good.
            I have a friend I play cards with that's looking for someone to look after his shop. Honest work for once."
            offered the patriarch.</p>
        <p>The words fell on deaf ears. Aris bit down on the last piece of bread his unskilled catching bought. As long
            as he provided for the family, he would always be welcome, they both knew it. </p>
        <p>Gracefully saying goodbye to his family for the evening, Aris stood up, packed up a few of his things and
            walked out from the house. As he was leaving, Mrs. Zarvaliss asked him to bring back a freshly caught
            Salmon, as tomorrow would be a big day. The young man did not quite remember which holiday they were
            celebrating, probably something with winning independence sometime five hundred years ago. In this village,
            no good cause went uncelebrated.</p>
        <p>Life here really is simple, thought Aris as he walked out from the house. He came out into a busy bustling
            street. His first instinct was usually to head right and down the stairs, right to a small dock beneath the
            house, where his small ship, the <em>Harvest</em>, was usually docked. </p>
        <p>But today he aimed for the town. He could see, even from this distance, that the town was brimming with life,
            something he didn't feel quite easy about. Big crowds always provoked trouble and Aris tended to steer clear
            of them. The path to the town was surrounded by few pines, bushes and a few blades of grass poking through
            the stones, but overall the road was well kept.</p>
        <p>Coming up to the first few houses, Aris noticed a familiar face sitting on a marble half-wall surrounding a
            garden of one of the finer houses of the town. A little girl, not older than a dozen years of age, sat high
            up on the wall and talked with her friends so excitedly, Aris could hear their laughter a mile away.
            Once she saw Aris, she quickly said goodbye to her friends and jumped down from the wall. It wasn't the
            smoothest landing, but she managed to keep her balance and hoped Aris did not catch it. </p>
        <p>She quickly ran towards him and gave him a big hug, before pulling back and excitedly asking: "So, did you
            find any?"
            Aris did not answer, just put forward two closed fists and motioned with his head for her to pick one.
            "Umm, left. No no, right." she said, unable to decide. Aris looked at her, as if disappointed with her
            choice. "Okay, the left hand, from my view, final decision". said the girl proudly.</p>
        <p>Aris opened the left hand, chosen by the young lady. In his palm sat a couple of colorful shells of various
            sizes. Although he would not admit it, he took more time that day finding the shells than actually doing his
            work. He was proud of them, more so than the pearls. </p>
        <p>"Ah, wrong again. I thought I had you this time!" laughed the little girl. Aris opened up the second hand,
            upon which sat the three pearls Aris did not tuck away, before quickly closing the palm again.
            "You know, the point is to guess the hand that <em>does</em> contain the pearls, right Kori?" he teased, "At
            least you can make another one of those necklaces you like. I think they look very good on you."</p>
        <p>Korina was like a sister to him. While not related by blood, he did practically raise her ever since she was
            washed ashore. Zarvalisses gladly took her in and as long as she cleaned her room and helped in kitchen when
            needed, she was free to play with the other kids. Aris tried to raise her as best as he could, given that
            Zarvalisses while welcoming, weren't the best role models or parents. In his spare time, he taught Kori how
            to read, count and even how to swim. In time, he might even pass on the torch of the pearl farming, but Kori
            was still a little girl and Aris had no problem letting her be a kid, something he never quite had. </p>
        <p>"So, Korina, what's the word around town, anything I should know about?" asked Aris as they were walking to
            the town together. A few years ago she might have even held his hand, but she's been growing more
            independent by the day, something he encouraged greatly.</p>
        <p>"Oh, I-, hmm," were the first sounds of thinking Kori spoke, "Well, Penelope's parents have been fighting,
            there's a new market in town selling melitoutta cakes, which you just have to try, and tomorrow the shops
            will be closed, so remember to buy everything you need." Short, quick and to the point, Aris taught her
            well. </p>
        <p>"Oh, and one more thing, apparently all the mussels on our beachfront have been fished up, so the boys were
            talking about expanding their radius to that bay you frequent. But you've caught everything there, so they
            won't find any, right?" asked Kori. </p>

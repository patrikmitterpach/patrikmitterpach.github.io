        <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
        <p>The house Aris lived in was built partly on a river, which was currently running red with the blood of the
            innocents. Aris wasn't quite sure who was on the offensive, but he knew he had no chance in taking on the
            attackers by himself. The best he could do was sneak in, grab the pearls stashed somewhere in his room
            hopefully, and get out.</p>
        <p>He parked his boat beneath the house, but he could not get in from there. He would have to climb up to a
            small dock they had, take the stairs going up the left side of the foundations until he emerged in the
            street, from where he could enter the house through the front door. Inconvienient, to say the least.</p>
        <p>He tied a quick knot around one of the poles of the dock, pulled out his knife and methodically climbed up
            the stairs. Having a low-ground would be a disadvantage if any brawl occured, so he had to hope no one would
            catch his presence. After climbing the set of stairs and getting a first look into the street, he saw an
            older woman surrounded by four armed men, opposite the stairs and the house Aris needed to enter. Their
            armor was primitive, with each piece having an obviously different visage. This was no professional army.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn bandits", thought Aris to himself.</p>
        <p>He could not help her, he knew. If he tried to intervene, maybe he'd get a jump on them and take out one or
            two, but against four grown men he stood no chance, or at least that's what he told himself. </p>
        <p>One of the men raised his sword and with one swift motion cut down the old woman. Aris knew her, she was a
            neighbor and he'd played with her sons when he was younger. Poor soul.</p>
        <p>But this was his opportunity. As they were too busy ransacking the dead woman's belongings, Aris snuck by,
            using some crates left out in the street as cover. He quickly entered the house, which had been left empty.
            Maybe Zarvalisses got away safely. The house had to have been left quickly, the salmon was laying on a
            plate, portions half eaten. </p>
        <p>Letting the stress overtake him, Aris did not feel how quite hot he was. The fire started in the house next
            door and was steadily spreading to Villa Zarvallis, something he did not register in the slightest. Aris
            climbed the stairs towards his room and quickly entered and shut the door behind him. </p>
        <p>"Where could they be?" he asked himself as he frantically searched the room. Under the bed, on the bedside
            table, in his chest, in the bathroom, he could not find his pouch anywhere and slowly came to terms with the
            fact that the pearls were gone. Two or three hundred of them, worth a few years wages of a commoner, all
            gone. No use dying over them now, Aris decided to evacuate the village immidiately. He could hear the fight
            outside, and once he opened the door a wave of scorching air attacked him. The house was engulfed in flames
            and he knew that he should run as soon as humanly possible, but still he hesitated. Once he was down, he
            would not be able to return.</p>
        <p>After a second thought, Aris decided to speed down the stairs. He could not die here, he would not die here.
            Feeling the burn with every step, he made his way downstairs, which was overtaken by flames and smoke. The
            young diver knew how to hold his breath for several minutes, but he wasn't fire resistant. </p>
        <p>Rushing out of the house, Aris quickly found himself in the company of the five barbarians staring him down.
            He first noticed the tall and bulky bandit in the middle, who seemingly was their boss. Aris knew he only
            had a few seconds to act, so he quickly screamed: "Don't kill me, I have an offer for you!"</p>
        <p>The bandits on the sides, ready with their swords to end Aris's life, looked at their captain, who was
            holding a big double-sided axe. He nodded with his head to Aris, who was now holding both his hands up.</p>
        <p>"I-, I have a, let's call it a business proposition." he told the mean man quickly. His words were the only
            thing keeping him alive and he knew it, so he chose an intonation that would be heard over the sounds of
            carnage within the village. He motioned with his left hand, high up in the air, towards a small coin purse
            on his belt.</p>
        <p>After the captain nodded, telling Aris to proceed, he slowly lowered his left hand towards the purse and took
            out the pearl he had caught early in the morning.</p>
        <p>"You know what this is, right?" he asked. "I have two hundred like these, tucked away in a secret place. Let
            me live, at least for now, and I'll give them to you", offered he rather enthusiastically, as if his life
            depended on it. </p>
        <p>The captain lowered his axe, and his men did the same. They were at least interested in pursuing the offer on
            the table. All their sights were on the pearl, shining in the daily light.</p>
        <p>Good, now for the worst part, Aris exhaled, and flung the pearl with all his might of a discus thrower behind
            the captain. All the men reflexively turned towards it, which allowed just enough time for Aris. With the
            bandits momentarily distracted, the diver turned around and ran straight into the burning house. He had a
            feeling his friends would not follow.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

        <p>Having distracted the brawlers, Aris ran straight into the burning house. A wave of smoldering hot overcame
            him as he entered, but he pressed on. Making sure not to breathe in any of the fumes, he ran towards the
            back. He barely had time to look around and see his family home in flames. All the memories, all the
            carvings he crafted, all the decorations Mrs Zarvaliss worked so hard for, all soon but dust.</p>
        <p>He ran through the house, finally reaching the kitchen, from which he'd usually look down towards the sea
            through an open air window. With a few swifter steps and one far leap, he soon jumped through the window and
            down below. The idea was terrible and could result only in disaster. He'd either not fly far enough to hit
            the water, landing on the dock and breaking most of his bones in the process, or he'd reach just far enough
            to fall down on his boat. Even a fall like that would most likely sink the <em>Harvest</em> right where it
            stood.</p>
        <p>By some miracle, perhaps a merciful goddess watching over and giving him just enough speed, he'd cleared not
            only the dock, but the boat as well and landed firmly in the water. There was a good chance the bandits out
            front had not heard his fall and simply thought he just chose to die in the house, a more painful death than
            being decapitated by the captain's axe. He hoped they were satisfied in the encounter, walking away one
            pearl richer. </p>
        <p>Aris forcefully hit the water and thanked all gods for getting to live another moment. The young man then
            quietly swam towards his boat, not emerging from the water until the moment he got on the boat. He laid down
            inside, cut a rope with his knife and pushed off the dock with his hand. </p>
        <p>Still laying down, he remained absolutely still, as the boat gently carried down the current. He did not even
            dare to look up, just kept his head down as the sailboat gently floated out to the sea, further and further
            away from the village. Aris listened to the sounds of fight in the village. Screams of men, pleadings of
            women, all the sounds slowly quieted down as the boat got further and further from the village. All sounds
            but one. Aris realized, throughout the whole trip he could hear a faint cry, which slowly isolated itself as
            the village got further and further away.</p>
        <p>Finally, the diver felt confident enough to look around in his boat. He did not feel to confidence to pop his
            head out, he still might have been seen, but he felt that he could turn himself the other side and maybe
            watch the town disappear in the distance. Upon raising his body somewhat and switching sides, he realized he
            wasn't alone in the boat. Opposite him sat the familiar little girl, holding her legs to her face,
            concealing the tears.</p>
        <p>"I didn't, didn't mean to-, I did not want this to happen.", cried Korina, scared to death. "they, they're
            all gone and it's because of me."
            "What are you talking about? What happened?" whispered Aris.
            "I-, I," sniffled Kori, "I wanted to just have a look at them. Mrs, Mrs Zarvaliss always told us not to
            steal, that terrible things happen to, to those who steal, but I didn't listen, and now they're gone", she
            said.
            "What did you steal, something from the bandits? Is that why they've attacked?"
            "No, no, I did not steal a-anything from them, they, they were just sent to punish me." stuttered Kori
            distraught.
            "What did you steal then? Did you cause any of this?" Aris asked. He wanted to be gentle, but it also seemed
            like knowing what Korina knows was of dire importance in this moment. </p>
        <p>Korina did not answer, instead she lifted her cloak partly, revealing a small, leather pouch, which was well
            known to Aris already. The pearls, all this time safely with Korina. Aris caught himself exhaling with
            relief, but Korina still had tears running down her face. He scooted himself over towards her and motioned
            for her to lay down next to him. He hugged her as she cried.</p>
        <p>"It's not your fault, none of this is." he reassured her. The poor girl was shaking still, scared that all
            this wrath has been brought upon the town because of her. She was always told by the elders not to steal,
            that the Gods would take their revenge, and it finally happened. Aris did not ask, but he figured out what
            had probably happened. </p>

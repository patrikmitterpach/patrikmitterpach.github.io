        <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
        <p>"Do not be afraid my child." whispered a pleasant, flowery female voice.</p>
        <p>Korina shook herself wide awake. Must've been a dream. There was no woman on the boat, Kori had to have
            imagined it. Seemed so real though, she thought to herself.</p>
        <p>"Hey, look who's up, and so early, it's only... an hour before lunch!" said Aris, looking up at the rough
            position of sun in the sky. He was sitting at the back of the ship, steering the boat as it gently traveled
            down the streams of the ocean waters. For a few days they had been coasting by the seashore of their island,
            looking for a port untouched by the bandits.</p>
        <p>"Tough dreams?" he asked concerned.<br />
            "Nope, not at all." answered Korina.<br />
            "So, all that shaking and twitching, that was just the water spiders biting you?"<br />
            "WATER SPIDERS?" Korina started looking around nervously. After a while, she realized he wasn't
            serious.<br />
            "Oh you, are there even any water spiders?" she asked.<br />
            "Of course not, hah," and in a quieter tone added, "not now anyways, they only come out at night."<br />
            The little girl punched him. </p>
        <p>After finishing her breakfast, a fish with pastries that were forgotten in Aris's boat, Korina finally asked
            the question Aris was dreading the most.</p>
        <p>"So, can we return home now?"<br />
            "I, I'm sorry Kori," Aris answered, "I don't think there's any <em>home</em> left to be honest. But I'll try
            to come up with something, I'll take a job in the first village we'll find. Don't you worry, your brother
            can take care of you, no matter what Andreas thought." He seemed visibly depressed by the turn of events
            that left them homeless, with all their belongings currently limited to the ship they were sailing on, along
            with the hundreds of pearls Aris was keeping safe.</p>
        <p>Aris paddled on, trying to keep a steady course as they both scanned the coast for any signs of life. The
            last three villages they came around were burned down with no signs of any survivors. Aris was as confused
            as anyone as to why the bandits got so aggressive in the past weeks.</p>
        <p>"Look there!" Kori suddenly shouted. Aris, shaken out of his daydreams, turned his head, only to see an
            intriguing sight. In the distance on a cape stretching out to meet their boat, there laid an outline of a
            massive sail pole, broken in half. The mighty pillar was snapped in the middle and the upper part was driven
            deeply into the sand of the beach. </p>
        <p>"What do you think that is?" asked Kori.<br />
            "Well, it's either a shipwreck or just a really big narwhal, one of those two." Aris replied seriously.
            Korina gave him an annoyed look and continued to examine the wreck in the distance</p>
        <p>As they were unable to recognize any more details this far away, Aris decided to come in closer. He grabbed
            both oars by the handles and with a mighty exhale kicked off the boat to much more than just a cruising
            speed. Given her curiousness, Kori decided to help, grabbing one of the spare paddles and submerging it by
            the left side of the boat. With how unsynchronized the siblings were at paddling, her efforts might have
            slowed them down, but Aris let her help. She'll learn eventually, he thought.</p>
        <p>Soon they were on approach and the details became much more clear. The ship on the shore was completely
            demolished, leaving pretty much just the pole and a few pieces of hull here and there. Getting even closer,
            Aris noticed that one of the pieces of hull sticking out from under the sand, originally of roughly square
            size, now had a giant bite mark alongside its left side. Even at this distance, Aris estimated the mouth of
            the creature that had snacked on the boat to be several meters across. </p>
        <p>"Do you see <em>that?</em>" he pointed out to Kori in a low voice.
            "What is it?" asked the girl and moments later added, "OH."<br />
            "That, that thing is a sign for us to get the hell back on shore." said Aris.<br />
            "Do you think it's still around, the monster?" asked she worried.
            "Well, I don't intend to find out, but I think we may be safer on shore than here, floating on the water. It
            did chew down on <em>a ship</em> after all."
            "Do you wanna go take a look? Maybe there's something left on the ship, some crates or supplies. I really
            don't want to eat fish again."
            "Perhaps.." said Aris in a drifting tone. "Let's wait around and check it out when it's dark, that might be
            safer."</p>
        <p>Aris steered the boat and aimed for the beach, a few paces away from the shipwreck.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, when the sun started to set, they both gathered their things, hid their boat in nearby
            bushes and walked down the beach towards the wreckage. Aris was leading the way, while Korina held his hand.
            She tried to be brave.</p>
        <p>Arriving to the shipwreck stealthily, Aris examined the first pieces of wood they came across. While they
            showed some signs of struggle between the ship and whatever attacked it, they were also still rather wet to
            touch. The sea could not have reached this place even during high tide, so the crash had to have been
            recent. </p>
        <p>Aris did not like any of the scenarios he imagine had happened to the boat and its crew. Either the captain
            had run it aground, which seemed improbable based on the distance between the hull and sea line. Aris knew
            that even during a high tide, the ship could not have run so far into the sand. It would've been stuck in
            the shallow waters, sure, but it would not be completely out of the sand. Only other explanation, however
            impossible, seemed to be that the ship had been thrown by an unknown being right out onto the sand. But with
            the size of the vessel, the monster had to have been..</p>
        <p>Absolutely massive. </p>
        <p>"Come on, let's go, best not spend too much in this open space." he hurried Korina inside the biggest piece
            of the hull left, which seemed to be the back of the now wrecked ship. </p>
        <p>The moon was shining high in the sky now, and Aris cautiously entered the hall of the ship, Usually what was
            a hall leading through the middle of the lower deck was now an entrance to the two siblings. They both
            slowly walked in and started scouting the wreck room by room. Starting on the left, they entered into what
            were private sleeping quarters for the crew. </p>
        <p>"Where do you think they've gone?" asked Kori quietly.
            "They left most of their personal things here, can't imagine they were prepared to leave the ship. Best case
            scenario, they got out on a raft. Worst case.. I'd rather not think about that." replied her brother.</p>
        <p>He took out his knife and started scouring through the things left by the crew mates. They usually were not
            very rich, and the little money they received was usually burned at the nearest port, but still, Aris
            searched. All in all, he found a few gold coins, some personal portraits of the sailors and their families,
            and an empty journal.</p>
        <p>"You want this?" he said and threw the journal to his sister. She excitedly opened it up and after examining
            it Kori replied,
            "Yes pleaaase."</p>
        <p>He handed her a pen he found among the wreckage, and as he was reaching over to her he noticed a faint
            glitter on her chest.</p>
        <p>"What's that?" he motioned to the jewel Korina had around her neck. "Where did you-," he paused, "did you
            steal it from the pouch?"
            "Maybe..", Korina smiled.
            "Give it back!" he told her in a slightly louder voice.
            "You're gonna have to take it from me if you want it so much!" she replied, and before Aris could react she
            ran away back into the hall.</p>
        <p>"You-", he started to reply, but quickly realized Korina was running away and chased after her. She ran
            through the hall they came from down to the kitchen, with Aris running close behind her. With the brief look
            Aris gave the kitchen while he was running through, he noticed the room to be unexpectedly empty. He
            would've bet these kitchens used to be full of food, but now he could not see a cleaver or a knife left.
            Still, he ran after Korina, who had now taken a tour through the storage room. There was no way she was
            letting Aris catch her, not yet anyways.</p>
        <p>The storage room was still rather full with supplies, boxes and sacks containing everything a large group of
            sailors might need on their trip. Aris could not be sure why this ship was taking the trip and the supplies
            were not much of a clue.</p>
        <p>Kori has now decided to run up the stairs leading up to the upper deck, and Aris was in her tail the entire
            time. After running up, he noticed Korina frozen, standing a few paces away from the stairs leading up to
            the deck. Looking a bit up, Aris noticed the large group of men, who have noticed the sibling's presence and
            were now raising steel cutlasses and aiming weapons their way.</p>

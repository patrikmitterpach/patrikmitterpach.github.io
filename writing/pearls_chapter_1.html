        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>Aris dove head-first into the crystal clear water. The water was cold and salty, but the sea was quiet today
            and he really couldn't have wished for better conditions. With the first few strokes, he found himself
            floating close to the bottom, where the real work began. He could see the sea life reacting to his presence,
            as a nearby school of fish sped off in fear of a predator.</p>
        <p>But he wasn't interested in fishing, at least not today. He scouted the floor of the sea and after a few
            seconds saw what he'd been looking for - a small oyster, partially hidden in a patch of sea grass. Swimming
            over to it, Aris took out his knife, dulled by the years of use.</p>
        <p>"Here you are, my little friend", thought Aris as he approached to oyster, "what have you got for me?"</p>
        <p>With a swift move, practiced so many times already, Aris skillfully wedged the knife into a small opening on
            the front and with a smooth motion opened up the treasure.</p>
        <p>This wasn't the way it was usually done, at least in Aris's culture. Usually, the lesser skilled divers of
            the village would jump into the water, collect as many oysters as they could fit in a net or a shirt, and
            open them up on shore with a hammer. Needless to say, the the mollusks weren't fans of the practice and
            neither was Aris. The method was quicker and easier, but he realized a simple thought: by leaving the
            oysters alive, he could just come back a few months on and collect newly produced pearls. He could remember
            or write down the location, even move the oysters closer together. This meant he had to do fewer dives,
            scout fewer locations and still he could come out ahead of his competitors. </p>
        <p>This method was exceedingly effective and relied on only one factor - utter secrecy. The common thought
            around the land was that oysters could only produce one singular pearl during their lifetimes. This story
            made the pearls outstandingly rare and desirable, so if everyone had known that the rarity of pearls was
            exaggerated and so was their price, Aris's profits would plummet quickly. After collecting a few more
            pearls, leaving the oysters in their place, Aris pushed off from the floor, surfacing quickly. Usually, one
            would go up with a little bit more gentleness, but Aris was diving in a shallower part of the gulf. Finding
            his boat floating not too far from the place he'd surfaced, he swam towards it carefully, making sure not to
            drop the pearls.</p>
        <p>Normally Aris would spend the whole day diving, but today had been successful enough. Including the ones
            collected before lunch, Aris had found a two dozen pearls, which usually would have been a week's work of
            other divers. The sun was still high up in the sky as Aris climbed on his sailboat, <em>Harvest</em>.</p>
        <p>The <em>Harvest</em> was a small, shoddy vessel made for small excursions to calm waters and taking it out to
            the wide sea would have equaled a death sentence. It was made of smooth, light cedar and while it did not
            have a sail, it did come with a pair of oars included. There were two benches on which to sit, with one
            usually going empty. To keep the secret of the oyster farms, Aris worked alone, spending hours just by
            himself. The boat, while not ideal, sufficed for the scheme, so when Aris saw it on a market a few years
            back, he did not hesitate with the purchase.</p>
        <p>Once aboard the <em>Harvest</em>, Aris took a deep breath. Despite his strategy, the work of a pearl hunter
            was tenuous and dangerous. Be it through getting lost at sea or encounters with one of the dangerous
            creatures of the sea, most hunters wouldn't make it past thirty, an age Aris was approaching steadily. After
            taking a breather to calm down, Aris took out the pearls and counted them. </p>
        <p>Twenty seven pearls. All glimmering in the shine of the high sun. Aris picked out three pearls and put them
            away in his pocket, stuffing the rest in a small pouch tucked away beneath one of the benches. After hiding
            the most of his earnings, he grabbed the paddles and set off back towards the village. </p>

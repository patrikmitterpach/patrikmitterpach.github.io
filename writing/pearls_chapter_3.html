        <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

        <p>Aris ran to his boat the first thing next morning. He did not even take time to put on a shirt, just a
            quickly wrapped cloth around the waist would have to suffice. Paddling more quickly than ever before, Aris
            sped towards the bay where his little farming operation took place. "The brutes can't find my little oyster
            friends", he thought.</p>
        <p>He could just imagine the events, were he not to intervene. The brutes fish up a hundred mussels, all
            conveniently found in the same location. Upon breaking them, they would find each of them in a different
            stage of a pearl growth, with all of them being previously opened and then closed. While they are not the
            brightest folks under the sun, even they would realize that their methods were not quite as effective. A new
            pearl fishing renaissance would come about, leading to a more civilized collection, which would be of
            significant benefit to both the mussels and the brutes. The only one who would lose out would be the idiot
            that let the secret out. And that idiot could not let it happen.</p>
        <p>Speeding since the early days of dawn, Aris got there early enough, hours before the first fisherman even
            showed up. Collecting the oysters into a net he kept in his boat just in case, he slowly and methodically
            moved all of them to a more distant gulf, just for now. He'd think of a better plan meanwhile, for today all
            he needed to do was delay the deadline, even if by a few days. </p>
        <p>This took him a better part of the day, finishing up sometime around the early afternoon. As Aris was
            collecting one of the oysters, he saw a pearl ready that he must have missed during the previous days.
            Taking out his trusty knife, he hacked the oyster open, extracted the pearl and closed it up again. </p>
        <p>"Let's put you away with your friends, what do you say?" he whispered to the pearl. He reached under the
            bench where he usually stored his pouch, only to find..</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The pouch was not there.</p>
        <p>He reached again, looked about, only to find that the pouch was not present in the sailboat. "Hm, that's odd,
            I could've swore I left your friends here yesterday. I must've took it back home with me, maybe I wanted to
            count the pearls in peace", Aris thought out loudly to the pearl he was holding. These things happened every
            now and then, with the sun and exhaustion, he often thought it was miraculous he even sailed home in one
            piece. </p>
        <p>Aris estimated that sometime around this hour, the first fishermen should be already coming to the bay, only
            to find the cleverly placed nothing Aris left there. "Better head back to the village, the celebrations
            should be in full swing by now."</p>
        <p>Paddling along, he sang a song to himself. On the way, he did not meet any of the pearl catchers Kori warned
            him about yesterday. Despite it being the holiday, the boys should've already been combing the seafloor here
            looking for the pearls, but there were none. She must've heard something wrongly, Aris thought to himself.
        </p>
        <p>The day was sunny and the winds blew ferociously. Aris wondered to himself whether he could manage to install
            a pair of sails on <em>Harvest</em> himself or whether he'd have to pay someone. He reckoned he might be
            able to deal with the task himself, maybe he would have to recruit Kori to his help, when suddenly, his
            thoughts were interrupted. Coming over on the horizon, he could see his village, with pillars of smoke
            rising atop. </p>
        <p>"It's a little too early for the pyre, isn't it?" he thought to himself, but that line of thinking was
            quickly proven otherwise. As he sailed closer to the village he begun to hear the first screams and seeing
            the closest beach houses aflame, meaning only one thing. </p>
        <p>The village was under attack. </p>

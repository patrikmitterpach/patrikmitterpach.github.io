        <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

        <p>Korina walked by Aris's side as they entered the town square. Still a sore loser about only winning a bunch
            of shells, she wasn't up to much talking. Instead she preferred to wonder at the sights of the town,
            including wonderful gardens, shops full of the freshest fruit and fish, and people walking about wearing
            some of the finest wear Korina had ever seen.</p>
        <p>The fashion within these small fishing villages was remarkably dull, but holidays and the evenings before
            were a welcome exception. Especially the annual celebration of the goddess Zelene, mother of nature. This
            year's fashion was dominated by the color green, ranging in shades everywhere from pine, moss or basil
            green. Whether it be worn on cloaks, chitons, or other garments, Korina thought that browns went well with
            the green. She was dissapointed not to see many people wearing the combination, instead opting for shades
            that Korina saw as tasteless, such orchid purples or crimson reds. She had a faint idea of the fact that the
            combinations were not worn because they fit together well, rather that the owners of the outfits wanted to
            show off the expensive dyes, but they all left a sour taste in Korina's mouth. This was supposed to be a day
            of giving thanks to the earth and the gifts it brought, instead the citizens only worshipped themselves and
            their egos.</p>
        <p>The little girl knew Aris could barely discern navy blue from turquoise, so she did not bother him with the
            details. As they walked down the brick road, Kori noticed a planter full of lilies placed on the windowsill
            of a nearby shop. Coming in closer and dragging Aris behind, she noticed a small bee taking off from a petal
            of the nearest flower. She waved the bee goodbye as it flew away, and took in the smell of the plants.</p>
        <p>"Done already?" asked Aris after Korina smelt near every flower in the vicinity. "You know, if you wanted to,
            I could teach you how to grow ones just like those."<br>
            "Really?" replied Korina. "What about the basil I gave you for your birthday, how's that one doing?" she
            laughed. "Maybe you should teach yourself first."<br>
            "Okay, fair, no mentoring then. Did you get a look at the homework we talked about yesterday?" asked Aris as
            a way to get the upper hand back in the conversation.<br>
            "Oh gods, are you really talking about homework <em>now</em>? It's the holidays! Let's go enjoy the markets
            instead." replied Korina.
            "Not yet," said Aris. "the festivals are tomorrow, today we're just going-"</p>
        <p>"DONKEYS!", shouted Korina, not letting Aris finish. Donkeys weren't a common animal in this part of the
            world and Korina has seen in her dozen years a live donkey just once. "THEY HAVE- THEY HAVE DONKEYS! CAN WE
            GO-, GO RIDE THEM?" she said to Aris, not lowering her tone at all, despite him being right by her side.</p>
        <p>After a while of thinking, Aris let out with defeat a simple "okay". </p>
        <p>With the speed of an enraged sailfish, Korina sped towards a tent with one singular donkey going around in
            circles. The donkey had seen better days, but was sufficiently strong to carry Kori without much effort. She
            was still a smaller child, not much taller than her peers, and she was active enough that even the hearty
            meals of Mrs Zarvaliss weren't seen on her appearance.</p>
        <p>Paying the owner of the tent one singular copper coin, Aris was soon helping Kori climb up onto the donkey.
            She enjoyed the ride immensely. After a while of riding the donkey around in the tent, the little rider was
            surprised that the owner untied the donkey and handed the leash to Aris. Taking the lead of the ride, he
            took his sister on a ride around the town square. Korina did not know how he managed to convince the owner
            to allow such a favor, but truthfully, Aris just slipped the man a silver coin.</p>
        <p>Soon, Aris seemed tired of leading the stubborn horse around the town and decided to finish up and go home.
            Walking back to the shop, still leading Kori and her steed, he struck up the topic.</p>
        <p>"I'm gonna go home, do you wanna go with me or are you gonna stay for a while longer?" he asked.
            "Oh, already, like a chicken?" Kori teased him, but ultimately nodded to him. "I think I'll stay for a while
            longer, you can go without me," she said and quickly added, "remember to buy the salmon as she asked you to,
            remember?"</p>
        <p>"Ri-, right, I totally remember that." he said, like a liar.</p>
        <p>After Aris got sufficiently out of the view, the little girl's plan began to take shape. She was still
            feeling a little mad about only getting some colorful shells from her brother, so she decided to play a
            little joke on him. She would finally win for once.</p>
        <p><em>Step 1, go down to the docks, sneak to his ship.</em> </p>
        <p>Simple enough, there wasn't even much sneaking to be worried about. Only potential obstacle were the colorful
            flowers in the windowsills distracting Kori from reaching her goal. To be fair, she only stopped by <em>for
                a little while</em>, before continuing on. Eventually, she got back to Villa Zarvaliss. Usually she'd
            head inside and straight to her room, but today she was on a special mission. Climbing down the stairs
            beside the foundations whilst making sure not to be seen by anyone wasn't an easy task, and yet she pulled
            the job off like a professional thief. </p>
        <p>The sun was setting slowly and the orange rays hit the waters of the small, private marina. Within the dock
            beneath the house, there sat the Aris's ship. Kori remembered her brother coming up with some stupid name
            for it, but she simply called it a <em>boat</em>.</p>
        <p><em>Step 2, climb aboard the boat and search for a pearl</em></p>
        <p>Aris was not a good fisher, at least that's what she gathered from the conversations he's had with their
            adoptive father. Nonetheless, he brought back <em>some</em> pearls, and with his clumsiness Kori made an
            educated guess that some pearls might have fallen out of his hands and landed somewhere within the boat. She
            had to find just one, one pearl to show her brother that she did not need him for the pearls and she was
            grown already. Then he'd take her seriously. </p>
        <p>All of this made a bit more sense in her head. </p>
        <p>Climbing aboard wasn't an easy task, keeping her balance was even more difficult. Her sea legs could use a
            little work, fortunately the knots Aris tied held strong. She'd rather not imagine what she would do if the
            boat started to drift to the open sea. Kori might have to eat a seagull or her own leg. That would be bad.
        </p>
        <p>Once she steadied herself, it was time to look around. She quickly realised the insides of the boat might be
            even worse than the outside. Aris did not bother with much maintenance and it was a miracle the boat was not
            leaking water inside. Looking about, Kori did not see much of importance. She expected to get aboard and
            immidiately see a dozen pearls glistening in the sun, pearls her brother somehow missed. No such luck.</p>
        <p>Looking all around the boat, she could not find anything besides some fishing equipment. Finally, after
            tiring of searching, Korina sat down on the bench of the boat in defeat. Letting her arms down, her fingers
            touched an odd leather texture.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" she thought to herself, before jumping down on all fours to better investigate the object
            hidden beneath the bench. Hidden right beneath, there stood a rather large pouch made of dark leather,
            treated with some protective oils, tied around with a short piece of a nautical rope.</p>
        <p>Kori immidiately grabbed it and opened it, curiosity getting the better of her. </p>
        <p>Inside, she saw dozens, maybe hundreds of pearls, all with differing sizes and colors. Her mind could not
            quite comprehend what she was looking at. She thought Aris could not hunt for pearls if his life depended on
            it, now apparently he owns an entire private collection? Something didn't add up, but Korina was too tired
            to investigate it further. All those donkey rides and flower smellings. </p>
        <p>She carelessly put the pouch away, tying it around her waistband. Finally, she left the boat and now it was
            time for step 3.<br><br></p>
        <p><em>Step 3: .<br><br><br></em></p>
        <p><em>Step 3: ..<br><br><br></em></p>
        <p><em>Step 3: ...<br><br><br></em></p>
        <p>Step 3: ???<br><br><br></p>
        <p>Korina was tired and unsure. She would figure it out in the morning, so she went back up to her room.</p>
        <p>In the morning, after waking up, she quickly tied a small piece of string around one of the pearls and hung
            it up around her neck. "This will show him", she thought. Kori decided to walk down to the docks and
            surprise her brother there. She knew that he wouldn't get out of bed before her, being the lazy sack he was.
        </p>
        <p>She casually got dressed, choosing a comfortable white tunic, accessorizing with a light red piece of cloth
            worn over the shoulder. The young girl had seen a few of the younger women in the village wear an outfit
            just like this, so she inspired herself, at least to the extent she could. Her daily outfit was finished
            with a pair of light, well-worn sandals that Aris bought for her last year.</p>
        <p>After getting dressed, Korina walked down the hall, passing Aris's room, eventually going down the stairs.
            Once down the stairs, she said bye to everyone present downstairs and walked out of the house into the
            street.</p>
        <p>Going down to the docks, she expected she had comfortable two to three hours before Aris showed up. She
            thought she would hang out by his boat, throw a couple of rocks down the pier, but to her surprise, Aris's
            boat was nowhere to be seen.</p>
        <p>"He must've woken up early," she thought, "ah, whatever, I'll come by later."</p>
        <p>After this surprise, Kori decided she'd rather go to the town than stand around waiting for her older
            brother. And her friends were bound to be jealous of her new necklace, so expertly crafted by Kori herself.
        </p>
        <p>Walking into town, she allowed herself to get distracted by a dozen places on the way. It was a holiday and
            the pace of life really wasn't very quick in these parts.</p>
        <p>Finally arriving by her friends, she showed off her new necklace.</p>
        <p>"Oh, wow, so your brother finally caught something?" asked Melissa, a mean girl Korina was not particularly
            fond of.<br>
            "Well, yes he-" tried to reply Korina, but was quickly interrupted.<br>
            "We've just been talking about how useless he must be. You know, Beatrice's brother caught three times as
            many of those little guys as your brother did." continued Melissa. </p>
        <p>Without much thinking, Kori jumped at Melissa. Usually, fist fights were more of a boy's thing, but Korina
            was not afraid to get her hands dirty. Melissa tried to get a few punches in, but all in vain. Soon, Korina
            got the upper hand and pinned Melissa down on the ground. </p>
        <p>"DON'T", said Korina and slapped Melissa, "TALK", she slapped again, "ABOUT", slap, "MY BROTHER", slap,
            slap, "THAT", slap, "WAY!". They weren't strong slaps, but half a dozen of them have left quite a mark.</p>
        <p>At this point her fighting caught the attention of a mother of one of the girls, who was standing a bit away
            from the scuffle. Kori saw the mother walking towards her and started to slowly stand up to face her. The young girl wasn't
            afraid. </p>
        <p>Kori suddenly heard a quick whistling sound as an arrow flew through the air, hitting the approaching parent
            square in the shoulder. The woman fell to the ground, clutching her upper torso. Korina now began to register
            increasing shouts, followed by the well known sound of the alarm bells going off around the village. It was
            clear now to her: the village was under an attack.</p>
        <p>At this point, Korina was controlled by the fight or flight instinct and the choice was clear. The young girl
            finally let go of Melissa, regained some sense of self and began to run. Kori ran back home as fast as her
            feet humanly could. Meanwhile, her surrondings began to break into chaos. She did not know who was attacking
            or why, but she had to run. Running down the street where her home was situated, her way was blocked by a
            group of armed thugs, currently in the process of slaughtering local neighbors. Each more scary than the
            last, Kori shuddered at the thought of getting caught. She wasn't sure what they would do, but knew it
            would not be good. </p>
        <p>The bandits haven't registered her yet, so Kori naturally thought to turn around and run back where she came
            from. Maybe she would find safety back in the town, maybe the local defenses fought back the bad men and she
            would be safe.</p>
        <p>She turned around, only to see her whole world shatter. </p>
        <p>The town was aflame and Kori could only hear screams and suffering from that direction. The local forces
            could not mount a successful defensive and were getting slaughtered by the dozens. She even saw some bandits
            riding horses, as they plundered and killed.</p>
        <p>There was no time hesitate. Every second she spent in the street decreased her chances of getting out alive
            by a significant amount. Thinking quickly on her feet, she ran into an alley leading down to the sea. She
            had no boat, but she was safe. Safer, at least. </p>
        <p>Now crouching in an alley, Korina hid between a couple of boxes from the next door's bakery.
            "I have to get out of here. This is bad." she thought to herself. "Maybe I could go down to the docks, Aris
            could be back by now. He'd know what to do, right?". Her brother could always be depended upon, she knew
            that. No matter how lazy he was, how much he acted like he did not care and kept to his own affairs, he
            would come through.</p>
        <p>Sneaking down to the beach, Korina kept a good lookout for any danger. She hardly defeated Melissa, winning a
            fight against a group of armed men would have been by all accounts impossible.</p>
        <p>Poking her head out from the alley down to the beach, she saw no visible danger. Had she been looking only at
            the seashore and not seen the carnage in town, she would've thought nothing was out of the ordinary. Looking
            around, she saw the waves crashing on the sand, a few house animals running away in fear, and a singular
            boat parked right on the dock under her house. Aris was back.</p>
        <p>Korina almost could not believe it. She knew if she managed to get to her brother, she would be safe.
            Gathering her whereabouts and surveying her surroundings, Korina felt pretty sure that there was no
            immediate danger threatening her. The young girl ran down to the family docks as swiftly as she could. "Aris is here, he came to rescue me!" she thought. "He's waiting there and we can escape together."
            The young girl dashed up a set of wooden stairs leading onto the dock, finally arriving to her
            brother's boat, only to find it empty. </p>
        <p>He wasn't there. </p>
        <p>Nobody was, nobody came to save her.</p>
        <p>She did not know how to steer a boat and eventually someone would find her there, someone would do bad
            things to her. Her mind flooded with the worst thoughts possible and soon the anxiety overcame her. Her
            family house above her was burning down, so she climbed aboard the ship, the only familiar place she had
            left.</p>
        <p>The tears rushed to her face as she broke down on the boat. This was a dire circumstance, a situation in
            which no one would save her. She was now fully alone.</p>
        <p>Having almost fully given up, her thoughts were interrupted by her brother jumping out of the house above
            her, screaming his lungs out, before finally falling down a few meters away from the boat.</p>

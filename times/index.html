<h2>You may, then, boldly declare that the highest good is singleness of mind: for where agreement and unity are, there must the virtues be. [Seneca]</h2>

<h3>Formula1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ran into checo at a mall
       near Houston last week</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] If Max
       Verstappen doesn't win the
       next race, Lewis Hamilton
       will repass him in career
       winning percentage again.</li>
<li>On this day in 2014, Jules
       Bianchi suffered a
       horrific crash at Suzuka
       that would claim his life
       almost 9 months later.
       While tragic, the legacy
       of his accident saw the
       introduction of new safety
       measures such as the halo
       and the Virtual Safety Car</li>
<li>Marko: Red Bull will
       consider its juniors, not
       Russell, for the future</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] Lando
       Norris has never placed
       outside of the top 5 in
       all of his race finishes
       since Australia. Heck of a
       streak.</li>
<li>[Sergio Perez] The moment
       that many of us dreamed
       of, 14 years ago it was
       announced that Mexico
       would return to F1. Time
       flies, what an incredible
       ride! Let’s go for more!</li>
<li>TIL at the 1984 German
       Grand Prix there was a
       190E touring car race
       where current and former
       F1 drivers raced each
       other including A. Senna,
       N. Lauda, A. Prost, J.
       Hunt, K. Rosberg, J.
       Brabham, P. Hill, J.
       Surtees. It was the last
       time active F1 drivers did
       a race in equal machinery.
       Senna won.</li>
<li>Jules Bianchi before the
       start of the 2014 Japanese
       GP, 10 years ago on this

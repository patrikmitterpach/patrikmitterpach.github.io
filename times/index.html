<li>max verstappen held a
       second press conference in
       the redbull hospitality
       that journalists got
       informed about beforehand.</li>
<li>[SCUDERIAFEMBOY] daniel:
       max has always been
       appreciative and
       supportive of our
       friendship. after japan he
       was one of the only guys
       that sent me a text and
       said “mate keep your head
       up, we know what you’re
       capable of! don’t listen
       to the noise.”</li>
<li>[Kym Illman] DANIEL HAS
       LEFT THE PADDOCK It was an
       emotional evening for
       Daniel Ricciardo and the
       wider F1 community. The
       VCarb driver was the last
       of the 20 drivers to leave
       the track tonight when he
       walked out of the paddock
       at 1:46am for what
       everyone believes is the
       last time as an F1 driver.</li>
<li>[Kylie Minogue] Someone
       pinch me! Wow, the
       chequered flag at the
       Singapore Grand Prix.</li>
<li>[Erik van Haren] After a
       second place, for many, a
       winner this weekend: Max
       Verstappen. “It's getting
       so soft, I don't want to
       continue like this.” “I'm
       at a stage in my career
       now where I don't want to
       deal with this kind of
       silly stuff all the time.”</li>
<li>Lewis Hamilton after being
       overcut with George
       Russell by Mercedes:
       "Sometimes, I wonder why I
       do this"</li>
<li>[Kym Illman] A last
       goodbye hug from a fellow
       West Australian</li>
<li>[Luke Smith] Official line
       from RB team principal
       Laurent Mekies in the
       post-race press release:
       "Given this may have been
       Daniel’s last race, we
       wanted to give him the
       chance to savour it and go
       out with the fastest lap."</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] Most
       points scored since Miami:
       Max Verstappen - 221 Lando
       Norris - 221 Oscar Piastri
       - 199 Verstappen had a
       52-point lead over Norris
       entering the Miami Grand
       Prix. He still has a
       52-point lead after
       Singapore, 13 races later.
       Still even. That's quite
       remarkable.</li>
<li>[@OscarPiastri] Without
       swearing, that was
       blinking warm. Good race,
       nice podium</li>

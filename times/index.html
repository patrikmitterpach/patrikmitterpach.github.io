<h2>How unhappy are they whose appetite can only be aroused by costly food. [Seneca]</h2>

<li>Ran into checo at a mall

<li>On this day in 2014, Jules
       Bianchi suffered a
       horrific crash at Suzuka
       that would claim his life
       almost 9 months later.
       While tragic, the legacy
       of his accident saw the
       introduction of new safety
       measures such as the halo
       and the Virtual Safety Car</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] If Max
       Verstappen doesn't win the

<li>[Sergio Perez] The moment
       that many of us dreamed
       of, 14 years ago it was
       announced that Mexico

<li>Today I learned that the
       Tipo 043 engine in the
       back of this 1994 Ferrari
       412 T1, was developed by
       Honda's former chief
       engine designer Osamu
       Goto. The 3.5l engine was
       putting out 850 horsepower
       on it's debut at the
       German Grand Prix that
       year, the most powerful
       V12 in F1 history.</li>
<li>On this day in 2014,
       Andrea de Cesaris was
       killed in a motorcycle
       accident on a freeway near
       Rome, Italy, crashing his
       Suzuki into a guardrail.
       He was 55 years old.</li>

<h2>Then, before I knew it, two things happened. One: the young South African Jody Scheckter, who had just started driving for the McLaren team, lost control of his car in the quick Woodcote corner, causing a huge pile-up. It was one of the biggest crashes there had ever been in Formula One, and it happened right before my very eyes. And two: I dropped my burger from the shock of it. [Adrian Newey]</h2>

       stepping toward something
       new. I believed in the

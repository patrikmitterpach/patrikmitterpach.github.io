<h2>I know not whether wisdom is not best displayed by calmness in the midst of annoyances, just as the greatest proof of a general’s strength in arms and men consists in his quietness and confidence in the midst of an enemy’s country. [Seneca]</h2>

<h3>Formula1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Could we see Lewis
       Hamilton drive the Ferrari
       in the post season test at
       Abu Dhabi?</li>
<li>James Vowles claims
       Williams will have “best
       driver line up on the
       grid” in F1 2025</li>
<li>Lead race from start to
       finish</li>
<li>Marko doesn't understand
       Audi: ‘Incomprehensible if
       Bottas gets the chance’</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] If Max
       Verstappen doesn't win the
       next race, Lewis Hamilton
       will repass him in career
       winning percentage again.</li>
<li>[Gallery] I stumbled
       across an official F1
       Arcade and bar in
       Birmingham UK</li>
<li>Perez's last 12 Grands
       Prix compared to his
       predecessors last races
       before they were sacked</li>
<li>Marko: Red Bull will
       consider its juniors, not
       Russell, for the future</li>
<li>Alpine engineer: "There
       are 7kW or 10HP, which
       isn't much, attributable
       to the engine as such, or
       at least to the part
       developed by Viry. The
       deficit is only 15% of the
       total [...] The rest is
       partly justified by poor
       gearbox performance, which
       is Enstone's
       responsibility."
       (Translation in comments)</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] Lando
       Norris has never placed
       outside of the top 5 in
       all of his race finishes
       since Australia. Heck of a
       streak.</li>

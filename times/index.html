<h2>The single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists detonated the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it. [Yuval Noah Harari]</h2>

<li>[Daniel Valente] If Max
       Verstappen doesn't win the
       next race, Lewis Hamilton
       will repass him in career
       winning percentage again.</li>
<li>James Vowles claims

<li>Marko: Red Bull will

       Russell, for the future</li>
<li>[Daniel Valente] Lando
       Norris has never placed
       outside of the top 5 in
       all of his race finishes
       since Australia. Heck of a
       streak.</li>
<li>Alpine engineer: "There
       are 7kW or 10HP, which
       isn't much, attributable
       to the engine as such, or
       at least to the part
       developed by Viry. The
       deficit is only 15% of the
       total [...] The rest is
       partly justified by poor
       gearbox performance, which
       is Enstone's
       responsibility."
       (Translation in comments)</li>
<li>TIL at the 1984 German
       Grand Prix there was a
       190E touring car race
       where current and former
       F1 drivers raced each
       other including A. Senna,
       N. Lauda, A. Prost, J.
       Hunt, K. Rosberg, J.
       Brabham, P. Hill, J.
       Surtees. It was the last
       time active F1 drivers did
       a race in equal machinery.
       Senna won.</li>
<li>[Sergio Perez] The moment
       that many of us dreamed
       of, 14 years ago it was
       announced that Mexico
       would return to F1. Time
       flies, what an incredible
       ride! Let’s go for more!</li>

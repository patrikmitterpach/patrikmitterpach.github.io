<h2>The laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. [Henry David Thoreau]</h2>

<li>[F1] THE BAKU POLE STREAK
       CONTINUES!!! For the
       FOURTH year in a row, it
       will be Charles Leclerc

<li>Albon trying to throw the
       airbox to the steward</li>
<li>With Lando Norris out in
       Q1, McLaren's impressive
       17-race streak of making
       it into Q3 with both cars
       every race since the 2023
       Abu Dhabi GP comes to an
       end. McLaren managed to
       make Q3 on 34 out of 34

<li>[Luke Smith] Norris tells
       Sky he had to lift in
       response to the yellow
       flags: "Everyone did their
       second laps, and I didn’t.
       Just unlucky, that’s all."
       "I’m still hopeful we can
       get a good result. I think
       the car is quick. The lap
       I was on, I would have
       gone 2nd. But nothing I
       can do."</li>
<li>[Tom Bellingham] Anyone
       else not a fan of F1
       showing the full lap from
       the first car on track in
       Q3, regardless if they are
       in the fight for pole or
       not? The only bit of
       Leclerc's incredible pole
       lap we got to see live was
       the final 2 seconds of him
       driving down the straight.</li>

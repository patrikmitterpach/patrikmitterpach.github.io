<h2>The single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists detonated the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it. [Yuval Noah Harari]</h2>

       was even bigger. But my

       school. So the gap
       decreased a little, but it
       is still 26 seconds. So I

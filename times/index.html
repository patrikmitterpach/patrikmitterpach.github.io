<li>On this day in 2014, Jules
       Bianchi suffered a
       horrific crash at Suzuka
       that would claim his life
       almost 9 months later.
       While tragic, the legacy
       of his accident saw the
       introduction of new safety
       measures such as the halo
       and the Virtual Safety Car</li>

       killed in a motorcycle
       accident on a freeway near

<li>Today I learned that the

       412 T1, was developed by
       Honda's former chief
       engine designer Osamu
       Goto. The 3.5l engine was
       putting out 850 horsepower
       on it's debut at the
       German Grand Prix that
       year, the most powerful
       V12 in F1 history.</li>

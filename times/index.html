<li>[Aston Martin] Adrian
       Newey begins new chapter
       with Aston Martin Aramco
       Formula One Team</li>
<li>[Erik van Haren] Aston
       Martin has now officially
       confirmed the arrival of
       Adrian Newey. He becomes
       Managing Technical Partner
       and also a shareholder.
       Newey will start on March
       1, 2025, and English media
       have already reported an
       annual salary of between
       20 and 30 million pounds.</li>
<li>Jeremy Clarkson: "Adrian
       Newey is house hunting in
       Oxfordshire, not
       Maranello", during British
       GP weekend in July.</li>
<li>How Adrian Newey's backed
       cars have fared in Formula
       1</li>
<li>[Philip Duncan] Newey on
       Alonso: “We have battled
       against each other for
       many years. He’s been an
       arch enemy at times. We
       came so close to him
       joining Red Bull for the
       2009 season but it didn’t
       happen which was a great
       shame. He is a legend of
       the sport and I look
       forward to working with
       him.”</li>

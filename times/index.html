<li>With Lando Norris out in
       Q1, McLaren's impressive
       17-race streak of making
       it into Q3 with both cars
       every race since the 2023
       Abu Dhabi GP comes to an
       end. McLaren managed to

<li>[Luke Smith] Norris tells
       Sky he had to lift in
       response to the yellow
       flags: "Everyone did their
       second laps, and I didn’t.
       Just unlucky, that’s all."
       "I’m still hopeful we can
       get a good result. I think
       the car is quick. The lap
       I was on, I would have
       gone 2nd. But nothing I
       can do."</li>
<li>OTD 15 years ago, Rubens
       Barrichello won the 2009

        <h2>Leaving Windows</h2>
        <p>I tried, Bill. I honestly tried to like Windows. I jumped on the W11 train, mostly since there wasn't much keeping me on the W10 one. And I did kind of like a few changes that you've made. But there were several ones that compromised my experience, like the crashes. I haven't installed any viruses, I regularly updated the machine, and yet it crashed. Often. Not every week or so often, but every day, three or four times a day often. That's just unbearable, so I thought to reexamine the relationship a bit here.</p>
        <p class="comment">// note: it's hilarious to me to speak with Mr. William Gates here directly, despite the fact that he probably won't ever read this.</p><br>
<h3 class="yellow">Windows 11</h3>
<p>I liked the curved corners, I liked the menu redesign, but there were just some choices I couldn't exactly get behind. Why hide most of the right-click options behind another menu? Why move half the options to Settings, leave half to Control Panel, sometimes keeping both? And the wifi..</p>
<p>Oh god the wifi.</p>
<p>Several times a day, at unfortunate times, I'd get disconnected from my network, leaving me internetless. Yes, I do not have the best provider, using eduroam, but it wasn't their fault, this one's on Windows, simply because:</p>
    <li>Wifi is actually stable on my Linux machine now</li>
    <li>The whole option for Wifi in Settings disappeared</li>

<p>No, not just the wifi got disconnected. The whole menu, either in taskbar or in Settings was gone. I was almost being gaslighted, like there never was any Wifi menu. Usually a quick restart helped, but after a while that stopped working. So a shutdown, leave things to calm down and reboot, that ought to fix things. And it did, for a while. But after a week or two, again the same story, same toxicity, same gaslighting, only this time without any fix. I must've restarted a dozen times, still nothing. So I dug out an old flashdrive with PopOS on it and decided to give it a whirl. Uninstalled a few applications to make room for a nice, compact linux dual boot experience. You know, find a new roommate but not fully kick out the old one.</p>
<p>So, with 90 gigs of memory free I decided to do a partition, only to find out that C: is unpartitionable. Why is that? There's space, but you're taking all of it. Okay, apparently I have some BitLocker installed, possibly blocking my partition. After disabling that I went back to the menu to find out that... nothing changed, and apparently there was another partition menu now, in a different place in Settings. </p>
<p>I tried, I did what your tech forums wanted me to do, and you spit in my face. </p>
<p>If I'm going to have to solve tech problems either way, I think I'd prefer a community where people are actually helpful. So I burned it all down. Backed up a couple of important files, said goodbye and installed a clean popOS installation. And was it annoying, the first few hours with it. Scaling wouldn't work, USBs had problems, there was a lot. But usually, unlike Windows, the first advice on Stack Overflow usually worked and I actually managed to learn a little bit along the way.</p>
<p>Much happier now, much more serene.</p>
<h3 class="yellow">GitHub Copilot</h3>
<p>You made a nice site, I'll give you that Bill. The experience was great, discovery was amazing, the thing worked, so people naturally flocked in. Of course they're going to host their repositories here, have you even seen other options? BitBucket, GitLab? I've worked with them for five minutes before I've had enough. I did not like the gamification of coding through stars and follows, but I don't think that's quite what you've intended and it was limited to a few people at a time, so I don't hold a grudge over it.</p>
<p>And then you casually drop that you've actually scanned every single repository and are making a properiatary application to help with coding based on the information in those repositories. In these repositiories. Here. This repo, this file, this sentence. And this one. This one as well. This one probably not, it's getting repetetive.</p>
<p>I don't like it much, and yet I'm here.</p>
<p>Because you provide things better than others, sometimes.</p>

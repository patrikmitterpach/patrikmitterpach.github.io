   1. Max Verstappen:
       “It’s good that Formula
       1 is now paying extra
       attention to women in
       motorsports with F1
       Academy, although I
       question how they are
       doing it. The cars they
       drive are far too slow.
       If you ever want to get
       them into Formula 1, it
       really has to go to a
       higher level”

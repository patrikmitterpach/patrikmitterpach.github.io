       “We’re trying to say
       ‘We’ll do whatever you ask
       of us. We’ll do whatever
       is there. Now, if you
       think of something, you
       tell us,’. But they
       haven’t told us yet except
       for some excuses like, ‘Oh
       we don’t want you coming
       on, we don’t want you to
       be embarrassed.’

       Hamilton says to Sky he
       made "massive changes" to
       the car setup to
       experiment after the
       sprint. Hamilton: "I’ll
       give it my best shot. 18th
       is pretty bad. When I was
       making the setup changes,
       I was like, it can’t get
       any worse, surely, and it
       did! Shit happens."

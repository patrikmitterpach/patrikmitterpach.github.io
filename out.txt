	A man should be unbiased
     and not to be conquered by
     external things: he ought to
     admire himself alone, to
     feel confidence in his own
     spirit, and so to order his
     life as to be ready alike
     for good or for bad fortune.
     Let not his confidence be
     without knowledge, nor his
     knowledge without
     steadfastness.
                        ~ Seneca

# Formula1
   1. Apparently the
       released regs were never
       finally approved by all
       teams, and at least two
       teams are threatening to
       walk away from the series
       if they go ahead as
       released today. There are
       a LOT of angry team
       members across the grid.

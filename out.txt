	It is above all things
     necessary to form a true
     estimate of oneself, because
     as a rule we think that we
     can do more than we are
     able: one man is led too far
     through confidence in his
     eloquence, another demands
     more from his estate than it
     can produce, another burdens
     a weakly body with some
     toilsome duty.

	The inner curve is the
     one to take, not only in
     running races and in the
     contests of the circus, but
     also in the race of life;
     even literary pursuits, the
     most becoming thing for a
     gentleman to spend money
     upon, are only justifiable
     as long as they are kept
     within bounds.

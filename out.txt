Riches, I say, are not a
     good thing; for if they
     were, they would make men
     good.

       Hamilton. He's such a
       great figure in the sport
       of today, and he has
       achieved so much in his
       career, so I don't want to
       be seen as his

       next driver for Mercedes

       enough things to focus
       ourselves on.. That kind
       of stuff... in the end I
       don't care. I have to make
       sure the car gets better”

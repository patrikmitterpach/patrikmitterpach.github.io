	When we are considering
     a happy life, you cannot
     answer me as though after a
     division of the House, “This
     view has most supporters;”
     because for that very reason
     it is the worse of the two:
     matters do not stand so well
     with mankind that the
     majority should prefer the
     better course: the more
     people do a thing the worse
     it is likely to be.
                        ~ Seneca

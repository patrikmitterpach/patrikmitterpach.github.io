	I have accepted all the
     gifts of wealth, high
     office, and influence, which
     she has so bountifully
     bestowed upon me, in such a
     manner that she can take
     them back again without
     disturbing me: I have kept a
     great distance between them
     and myself: and therefore
     she has taken them, not
     painfully torn them away
     from m(1).

	Someone driving a $100,000 car might be
     wealthy. But the only data point you have
     about their wealth is that they have $100,000
     less than they did before they bought the car
     (or $100,000 more in debt). That’s all you
     know about them.

# Formula1
   1. Andretti Cadillac statement
   2. [Mario Andretti] I'm devastated. I won't say
       anything else because I can't find any other words
       besides devastated.
   3. [Chris Medland] BREAKING: F1 has rejected
       Andretti's bid to join the grid in 2025 or 2026, BUT
       says it "would look differently on an application" for
       2028 alongside General Motors' planned power unit
       entry
   4. [Chain Bear] GOOD. F1 is a place for gambling,
       finance and drinks companies; for ropey deals and
       brandwashing. Not established motorsport heritage.
       Begone, interlopers! Return when you've got a viable
       money laundering scheme to hawk!
   5. [Tom Bellingham] If Andretti had registered
       themselves as 'DHL PayPal Andretti Fuck Yeah America'
       then maybe F1 would have taken them more seriously...

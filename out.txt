	It is unpleasant,
     burdensome, and covers one
     with shame to have to say,
     “Give me.” You should spare
     your friends, and those whom
     you wish to make your
     friends, from having to do
     this; however quick he may
     be, a man gives too late who
     gives what he has been asked
     for.

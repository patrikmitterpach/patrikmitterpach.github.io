	At the present day, and
     in this country, as I find
     by my own experience, a few
     implements, a knife, an axe,
     a spade, a wheelbarrow,
     etc., and for the studious,
     lamplight, stationery, and
     access to a few books, rank
     next to necessaries, and can
     all be obtained at a
     trifling cost.

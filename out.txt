	While all excesses are
     hurtful, excess of comfort
     is the most hurtful of all;
     it affects the brain; it
     leads men’s minds into vain
     imaginings; it spreads a
     thick cloud over the
     boundaries of truth and
     falsehood.
                        ~ Seneca

   3. The 1st thing Max
       does when getting to his
       hotel: It's unpacking my

       the time you get into a
       discussion with the
       hotel because they’re
       like "Sir, we don’t have
       faster wifi". I’m like
       "I’m pretty sure you
       have" Like a 1 hour

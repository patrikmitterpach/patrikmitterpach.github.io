	“Why, if the wise man
     receives neither injury nor
     insult, he punishes those
     who do these things?” He
     does not revenge himself,
     but corrects them.
                        ~ Seneca

       Sargeant confirms he
       won’t be driving his
       original car and will
       instead be using the
       repaired Williams
       chassis, formerly driven
       by Albon, for this

“I must not fear. Fear is
     the mind-killer. Fear is the
     little-death that brings
     total obliteration. I will
     face my fear. I will permit
     it to pass over me and
     through me. And when it has
     gone past I will turn the
     inner eye to see its path.
     Where the fear has gone
     there will be nothing. Only
     I will remain.”
                 ~ Frank Herbert

    1. Max's sim set up at home
    2. In case you were not
       aware, there's another 1
       month break incoming after
       Singapore.

    4. [Peter Windsor] Looks as
       though RBR might have been
       running a clever rear
       cross-brake inertia valve
       before they were obliged
       to remove it before Miami.
       This could explain Max's
       RR brake drama in MEL and
       his turn-in grief since
       China.
    5. Danny Ric all smiles on
       summer break
    6. [Craig Scarborough] This
       makes sense and underlined
       by the tech reg change. A
       return of the Newey fiddle
       brake, but automatic &
       creating a turning moment
       with the rear brakes. A
       simple weighted valve in
       the rear brake splitter
       could do this. Altering
       the effort between the
       calipers as the car turns

       250 million Euros for
       renovations & new

    8. Max on his 2015
       Blanchimont overtake: We
       tried it on the sim. When
       I went for the move in
       real life, the car was
       moving around more. Helmut
       told me, "never do that
       again". I was like, "I
       passed him". Now I
       understand why. I was 17
       still, and I was like, "I
       go for it". Probably I
       wouldn't do it now.
    9. I am sure these 2 had gone
       on to have many more title
       battles…
    10. K-Mag's making moves. The
       drivers with the most
       positions gained in Grands

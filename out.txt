“What difference, then, is
     there between me, who am a
     fool, and you, who are a
     wise man?” “All the
     difference in the world: for
     riches are slaves in the
     house of a wise man, but
     masters in that of a fool.
                        ~ Seneca

    1. Red Flag: Antonelli
       Crashes in FP1
    2. Toto's Reaction to
       Antonelli's Crash
    3. Russell's reaction to
       antonelli's crash
    4. [Motorsport] Vowles on
       Sargeant: "He's reached
       the limit of what he's
       able to achieve & in fact
       it's almost unfair on him
       continuing that."
    5. [Adam Cooper] James Vowles
       says that pesos played no
       part in choosing Franco
       Colapinto - but the
       decision is now paying
       off: "The phone is still
       ringing off the hook. A
       number of Argentine
       companies, of which there
       are many, are calling, and
       they're paying market rate
       for stickers on the car."
    6. [Motosport.com] Vowles:
       "Mick isn't special, he
       would just be good. I
       think he would come with a
       lot more experience than
       Franco does. But the
       future of Williams isn't
       investing in the past."
    7. Piastri surprised by
       Sargeant’s F1 struggles:
       “His potential was much
       greater”
    8. Red Flag: Magnussen
       Crashes in FP2
    9. [Julianne Cerasoli]
       Antonelli did not give the
       interview scheduled for
       after the second F1 free
       practice session because
       he went to the hotel
       early, as he was not
       feeling 100%. The impact
       was 45G, according to Toto
       Wolff. After the crash, he
       was 6th in the F2
       qualifying.

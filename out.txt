	How late it is to begin
     life just when we have to be
     leaving it! What a foolish
     forgetfulness of our
     mortality, to put off
     wholesome counsels until our
     fiftieth or sixtieth year,
     and to choose that our lives
     shall begin at a point which
     few of us ever reach.
                        ~ Seneca

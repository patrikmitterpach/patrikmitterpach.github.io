	Unless we are the most
     ungrateful creatures in the
     world, we shall regard these
     noblest of men, the founders
     of divine schools of
     thought, as having been born
     for us, and having prepared
     life for us: we are led by
     the labour of others to
     behold most beautiful things
     which have been brought out
     of darkness into light: we
     are not shut out from any
     period, we can make our way
     into every subject, and, if
     only we can summon up
     sufficient strength of mind
     to overstep the narrow limit
     of human weakness, we have a
     vast extent of time wherein
     to disport ourselves: we may
     argue with Socrates, doubt
     with Carneades, repose with
     Epicurus, overcome human
     nature with the Stoics,
     exceed it with the Cynic(1).
                        ~ Seneca

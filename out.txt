	How late it is to begin
     life just when we have to be
     leaving it! What a foolish
     forgetfulness of our
     mortality, to put off
     wholesome counsels until our
     fiftieth or sixtieth year,
     and to choose that our lives
     shall begin at a point which
     few of us ever reach.
                        ~ Seneca

       “Whether I’m 13th or
       14th, I don’t know if
       any driver cares about
       that but I don’t, So if
       the team said let him
       [Yuki] back by before
       the finish line, I
       would’ve done it because
       it means nothing to me.

       points, who cares?

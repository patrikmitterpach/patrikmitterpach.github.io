	To dodge the submerged
     iceberg of industrial-scale
     food production and its side
     effects, to alter the course
     of this country and
     reinvigorate the economy,
     all I need to do is make you
     more interested in food. In
     total, we need to make 20
     million people more aware of
     eating. This will lead to
     changes, starting with
     breakfast. Then the snowball
     of consonant decisions takes
     care of the rest. Stranger
     things have happened.

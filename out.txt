	I have accepted all the
     gifts of wealth, high
     office, and influence, which
     she has so bountifully
     bestowed upon me, in such a
     manner that she can take
     them back again without
     disturbing me: I have kept a
     great distance between them
     and myself: and therefore
     she has taken them, not
     painfully torn them away
     from m(1).

# Formula1
   1. Max Verstappen:
       “It’s good that Formula
       1 is now paying extra
       attention to women in
       motorsports with F1
       Academy, although I
       question how they are
       doing it. The cars they
       drive are far too slow.
       If you ever want to get
       them into Formula 1, it
       really has to go to a
       higher level”

       Bottas' steering wheel?
   4. Charles: I had
       spoken with the
       [Bianchi] family, we are
       always in contact and we
       always speak, because
       it’s basically the same
       family. [...] they were
       so so happy that I had
       asked to use the helmet.
       Obviously, Jules is
       still there and needs to
       be remembered. If I’m
       here in F1, it’s thanks
       to him.

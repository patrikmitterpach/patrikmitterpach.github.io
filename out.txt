	I will so live as to
     remember that I was born for
     others, and will thank
     Nature on this account: for
     in what fashion could she
     have done better for me? she
     has given me alone to all,
     and all to me alone.

   2. [FórmulaDirecta]
       Reports @carlosmiquelf1
       that another of the
       possibilities that Carlos
       Sainz has on the table is
       RETURN to RB in 2025. The
       man from Madrid would
       return to his former team
       waiting for a spot to
       appear at Red Bull.
   3. I've been seeing
       these EL PLAN pictures on
       Alonso's 2021 Alpine and
       have been wondering since
       i first saw it, was it
       actually real? I only
       started watching F1 in
       2022 and wasnt around to
       actually see if it was
       real, if it is fake. Darn
       good job to the editors
       since the "editing" is
       splendid.

	High office, monuments,
     all that ambition records in
     decrees or piles up in
     stone, soon passes away:
     lapse of time casts down and
     ruins everything; but those
     things on which Philosophy
     has set its seal are beyond
     the reach of injury.
                        ~ Seneca

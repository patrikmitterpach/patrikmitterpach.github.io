We ought to withdraw
     ourselves from the forum and
     from public life, and a
     great mind even in a private
     station can find room
     wherein to expand freely.
     Confinement in dens
     restrains the springs of
     lions and wild creatures,
     but this does not apply to
     human beings, who often
     effect the most important
     works in retirement.

	“It is more
     respectable,” say you, “to
     spend one’s money on such
     books than on vases of
     Corinthian brass and
     paintings.” Not so:
     everything that is carried
     to excess is wrong. What
     excuses can you find for a
     man who is eager to buy
     bookcases of ivory and
     citrus wood, to collect the
     works of unknown or
     discredited authors, and who
     sits yawning amid so many
     thousands of books, whose
     backs and titles please him
     more than any other part of
     them?

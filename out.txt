	If one always follows
     the precepts of one man, one
     ceases to be a debater and
     becomes a partisan. Would
     that all things were already
     known, that truth were
     unveiled and recognized, and
     that none of our doctrines
     required modification!
                        ~ Seneca

       F1. If Horner falls, it
       won't be because of what
       he did or didn't do with
       that employee. It will
       be because they want his
       head. This does nothing
       to incentivise women to
       denounce behaviour of
       this kind.

It is the privilege of a
     tranquil and peaceful mind
     to review all the parts of
     its life.

    1. Max's sim set up at home
    2. [Peter Windsor] Looks as
       though RBR might have been
       running a clever rear
       cross-brake inertia valve
       before they were obliged
       to remove it before Miami.
       This could explain Max's
       RR brake drama in MEL and
       his turn-in grief since
       China.
    3. Max on his 2015
       Blanchimont overtake: We
       tried it on the sim. When
       I went for the move in
       real life, the car was
       moving around more. Helmut
       told me, "never do that
       again". I was like, "I
       passed him". Now I
       understand why. I was 17
       still, and I was like, "I
       go for it". Probably I
       wouldn't do it now.

    5. Danny Ric all smiles on
       summer break
    6. [Craig Scarborough] This
       makes sense and underlined
       by the tech reg change. A
       return of the Newey fiddle
       brake, but automatic &
       creating a turning moment
       with the rear brakes. A
       simple weighted valve in
       the rear brake splitter
       could do this. Altering
       the effort between the
       calipers as the car turns

       Michael, Unseen.
    8. I am sure these 2 had gone
       on to have many more title
       battles…

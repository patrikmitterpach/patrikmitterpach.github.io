	Help one man with money,
     another with credit, another
     with your favour; this man
     with good advice, that one
     with sound maxims. Even wild
     beasts feel kindness, nor is
     there any animal so savage
     that good treatment will not
     tame it and win love from
     it.
                        ~ Seneca

     to review all the parts of
     its life.

    4. F1 standings if using an
       Olympic-style table. The
       main difference is for
       Hamilton due to his two
       wins. I looked back to
       past years and most of the
       time it didn't affect
       Driver's champion. Since
       2000, only 2008(Massa
       instead of Hamilton) and
       2016(Hamilton instead of
       Rosberg) have changed.
    5. 2024 Standings if it was

       worth an 11-figure sum?

	Let us make presents of
     things which are rare and
     scarce rather than costly,
     things which even a rich man
     will be glad of, just as
     common fruits, such as we
     tire of after a few days,
     please us if they have
     ripened before the usual
     season. People will also
     esteem things which no one
     else has given to them, or
     which we have given to no
     one else.

   3. "I was just told now
       apparently he [Lance] was
       blaming me for it and if
       that's true - I was
       starting to calm down but
       that really pisses me off.
       I watched his onboard and
       as soon as we start to
       brake he starts looking at
       the corner...he's not even
       looking at me." [Daniel
       postrace on Viaplay]
   4. [Philip Duncan]
       Norris: “If you see the
       same driver winning every
       single time without a
       fight then of course it
       does start to become
       boring. You have got one
       of the best drivers ever,
       in one of the most
       dominant cars. It’s a
       deadly combination.”
   5. Regarding Stroll's
       claim that everyone in
       front of him suddenly

       everyone else didn't crash
       into each other."

	How late it is to begin
     life just when we have to be
     leaving it! What a foolish
     forgetfulness of our
     mortality, to put off
     wholesome counsels until our
     fiftieth or sixtieth year,
     and to choose that our lives
     shall begin at a point which
     few of us ever reach.

   1. [RedBullRacing]: "We
       understand that, without
       our agreeement, Alpine F1
       have released a statement
       regarding Esteban Ocon,
       causing wild speculation
       over our 'Stay tuned'
       announcement"
   2. [Red Flags Podcast]
       [Lawrence Barretto]:
       ''(Carlos Sainz) doesn't
       fall into that pool of
       supernaturally talented
       drivers like Lando, like
       Charles, like Max. But I
       think he probably falls
       into that pack of like
       Nico Rosberg 'but better',
       and Jenson Button 'but
       better'.''
   3. [@lawrobarretto]
       Jack Doohan has a strong
       shot at replacing Esteban
       Ocon at Alpine next year.
       Valtteri Bottas is very
       much in the mix, too.
       Alpine are keen on Carlos
       Sainz, but it seems the
       Spaniard is leaning
       towards Williams or
       Sauber/Audi. Mick
       Schumacher an outside bet

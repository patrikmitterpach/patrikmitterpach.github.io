	How many complain
     because they have been born?
     yet Nature is ever renewing
     our race, and even suffers
     men to live who wish that
     they had never lived. It is
     the property of a great and
     good mind to covet, not the
     fruit of good deeds, but
     good deeds themselves, and
     to seek for a good man even
     after having met with bad
     men.
                        ~ Seneca

	Those men whom you
     regard as fortunate, if you
     could see, not their outward
     show, but their hidden life,
     are really unhappy, mean,
     and base, ornamented on the
     outside like the walls of
     their houses: that good
     fortune of theirs is not
     sound and genuine: it is
     only a veneer, and that a
     thin one.
                        ~ Seneca

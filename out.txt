The inner curve is the one
     to take, not only in running
     races and in the contests of
     the circus, but also in the
     race of life; even literary
     pursuits, the most becoming
     thing for a gentleman to
     spend money upon, are only
     justifiable as long as they
     are kept within bounds.

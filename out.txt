	High office, monuments,
     all that ambition records in
     decrees or piles up in
     stone, soon passes away:
     lapse of time casts down and
     ruins everything; but those
     things on which Philosophy
     has set its seal are beyond
     the reach of injury.
                        ~ Seneca

# Formula1
   1. [@espnf1] Toto
       scooting past Lewis while
       he signs Ferrari caps
       feels like a scene from
       The Office
   2. [FórmulaDirecta]
       Reports @carlosmiquelf1
       that another of the
       possibilities that Carlos
       Sainz has on the table is
       RETURN to RB in 2025. The
       man from Madrid would
       return to his former team
       waiting for a spot to
       appear at Red Bull.
   3. I've been seeing
       these EL PLAN pictures on
       Alonso's 2021 Alpine and
       have been wondering since
       i first saw it, was it
       actually real? I only
       started watching F1 in
       2022 and wasnt around to
       actually see if it was
       real, if it is fake. Darn
       good job to the editors
       since the "editing" is
       splendid.
   4. Tsunoda would
       consider rival F1 team
       offers outside Red Bull
   5. Max Verstappen and
       Lewis Hamilton duelling it
       all out at the 2021
       Bahrain GP. This is really
       an epic reminder of how
       cracker of a season it
       was.

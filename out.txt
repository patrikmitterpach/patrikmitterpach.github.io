	With but few exceptions
     men’s life comes to an end
     just as they are preparing
     to enjoy it.

# Formula1
   1. [RaceFans] The FIA
       has changed its rules to
       allow 17-year-olds to race
       in Formula 1 if they have
       "consistently demonstrated
       outstanding ability and
       maturity in single-seater
       formula car competition."
       This would allow Mercedes'
       Andrea Kimi Antonelli to
       race in F1 this year.
   2. Fun Fact: Per FIA's
       F1 Superlicence System;24
       year-old Colton Herta who
       has 7 Wins,14 Podiums,12
       Poles in Indycar (second
       best open-wheel racing
       series in the world) isn't
       qualified for F1; whereas
       17 year-old Kimi Antonelli
       who has ''0'' Wins,
       Podiums or Poles in F2 or
       F3 could be qualified for
       F1.
   3. [Alexander Rossi]
       (on FIA's exception for 17
       year-olds getting SL) Oh
       so exceptions can be made?
       Huh.
   4. Guanyu Zhou holding
       up Lewis Hamilton on lap
       45 whilst being shown blue
       flags during the Canadian
       GP. This cost Hamilton 5
       seconds when chasing
       Piastri for P4 at the
       time.
   5. [Erik Van Haren] The
       FIA ​​confirmed that a
       dispensation request had
       been submitted and it
       logically concerned Kimi
       Antonelli. He will drive
       for Mercedes next year
       once Toto Wolff has
       finally given up hope on
       Max Verstappen. But could
       already gain experience at
       Williams this year, for
       example.

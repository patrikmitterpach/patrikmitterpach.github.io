“I must not fear. Fear is
     the mind-killer. Fear is the
     little-death that brings
     total obliteration. I will
     face my fear. I will permit
     it to pass over me and
     through me. And when it has
     gone past I will turn the
     inner eye to see its path.
     Where the fear has gone
     there will be nothing. Only
     I will remain.”
                 ~ Frank Herbert

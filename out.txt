	A man should be unbiased
     and not to be conquered by
     external things: he ought to
     admire himself alone, to
     feel confidence in his own
     spirit, and so to order his
     life as to be ready alike
     for good or for bad fortune.
     Let not his confidence be
     without knowledge, nor his
     knowledge without
     steadfastness.
                        ~ Seneca

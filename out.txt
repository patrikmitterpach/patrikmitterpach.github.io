	The ancients bade us
     lead the highest, not the
     most pleasant life, in order
     that pleasure might not be
     the guide but the companion
     of a right-thinking and
     honourable mind;
                        ~ Seneca

       Sargeant confirms he
       won’t be driving his
       original car and will
       instead be using the
       repaired Williams
       chassis, formerly driven
       by Albon, for this
       weekend’s race. Doesn’t
       foresee any issues with
       that as fix went better
       than expected. No spare
       until Miami.

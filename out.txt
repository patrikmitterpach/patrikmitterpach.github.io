	There are three kinds of
     life, and it is a stock
     question which of the three
     is the best: the first is
     devoted to pleasure, the
     second to contemplation, the
     third to action.
                        ~ Seneca

# Formula1
   1. [@TGruener] Adrian
       Newey is set to leave Red
       Bull according to our
       sources. We expect him to
       announce his decision
       soon. More on the exit
       date and who might get his
       service in the future in
       our AMuS story
   2. [BBC Sport] Adrian
       Newey: Red Bull design
       chief to leave team
   3. In case you think
       blue Ferrari overalls are
       heresy, here's a picture
       of Niki Lauda and Clay
       Regazzoni from 50 years
       ago
   4. [Julianne Cerasoli]
       Remembering that
       Verstappen always says he
       will continue at Red Bull
       if there is stability and
       peace. Newey leaving would
       bring neither.
   5. [Olav Mol] Should
       Adrian Newey decide to
       leave RedBull: contract
       what he has is until 2025
       plus a year's
       non-competition clause. So
       wouldn't be able to work
       for another team until
       2027 i.m.o. Opting for
       retirement may be more
       obvious.

	I see young men, my
     townsmen, whose misfortune
     it is to have inherited
     farms, houses, barns,
     cattle, and farming tools;
     for these are more easily
     acquired than got rid of.
           ~ Henry David Thoreau

       Verstappen was asked if
       his father regretted his
       comments: “I have not
       asked him that, but my
       dad is very outspoken

       that is for sure. My dad

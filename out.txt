	Those men whom you
     regard as fortunate, if you
     could see, not their outward
     show, but their hidden life,
     are really unhappy, mean,
     and base, ornamented on the
     outside like the walls of
     their houses: that good
     fortune of theirs is not
     sound and genuine: it is
     only a veneer, and that a
     thin one.
                        ~ Seneca

# Formula1
   1. Bearman's Headrest
       at the End of Race
   2. Ayao Komatsu: Once
       we got the penalty for
       Kevin, there was no way
       to get the points, so we
       made the gap to ensure
       that Nico could get the
       points. A good team
       effort. We are just
       fighting for P10, and
       there are eight drivers
       going for it, so it's
       like a win for the team.

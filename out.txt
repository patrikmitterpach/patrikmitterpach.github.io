	I have heard or
     observed, the principal
     object is, not that mankind
     may be well and honestly
     clad, but, unquestionably,
     that corporations may be
     enriched.
           ~ Henry David Thoreau

# Formula1
   1. [@chainbear] Feel
       like this might be a
       minority opinion but the
       near-obsessive deification
       of Senna is almost
       uncomfortable. I know it's
       an anniversary so
       heightened but... I have
       uneasy feelings that I
       don't quite know how to
       express

       Reports this morning that
       Carlos Sainz is out of the
       running for the Mercedes
       seat. He’s highly unlikely
       to get a Red Bull deal
       either, so maybe it’s time
       for him to finally pull
       the trigger on that Audi
       deal? In any case, we
       could get a resolution
       soon!

	Let us believe nothing
     unless it forces itself upon
     our sight and is
     unmistakable, and let us
     reprove ourselves for being
     too ready to believe, as
     often as our suspicions
     prove to.

# Formula1
   1. Apparently the
       released regs were never
       finally approved by all
       teams, and at least two
       teams are threatening to
       walk away from the series
       if they go ahead as
       released today. There are
       a LOT of angry team
       members across the grid.

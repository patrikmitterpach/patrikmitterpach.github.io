	Know then that every
     station of life is
     transitory, and that what
     has ever happened to anybody
     may happen to you also.

# Formula1
   1. Ricciardo's response
       to Alex Albon thanking him
       for the overtake.
   2. [RaceFans] The FIA
       has changed its rules to
       allow 17-year-olds to race
       in Formula 1 if they have
       "consistently demonstrated
       outstanding ability and
       maturity in single-seater
       formula car competition."
       This would allow Mercedes'
       Andrea Kimi Antonelli to
       race in F1 this year.
   3. [Alexander Rossi]
       (on FIA's exception for 17
       year-olds getting SL) Oh
       so exceptions can be made?
       Huh.
   4. [Erik Van Haren] The
       FIA ​​confirmed that a
       dispensation request had
       been submitted and it
       logically concerned Kimi
       Antonelli. He will drive
       for Mercedes next year
       once Toto Wolff has
       finally given up hope on

   5. Guanyu Zhou holding
       up Lewis Hamilton on lap
       45 whilst being shown blue
       flags during the Canadian

       Piastri for P4 at the
       time.

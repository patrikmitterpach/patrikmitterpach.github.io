	Too much pleasure is
     hurtful: but with virtue we
     need fear no excess of any
     kind, because moderation is
     contained in virtue herself.
                        ~ Seneca

       any driver cares about
       that but I don’t, So if
       the team said let him
       [Yuki] back by before
       the finish line, I
       would’ve done it because
       it means nothing to me.

       points, who cares?

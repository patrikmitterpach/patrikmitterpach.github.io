# Formula1
   1. [Sky Sport F1
       Germany] Haas driver Nico
       Hülkenberg is set to drive
       for Audi in 2026. Audi is
       said to be offering
       Hülkenberg a 3-year
       contract, but there is no
       official statement yet.
   2. Q: If you have kids,
       would you train him like
       how your dad trained you?
       | Max: I'd advise him not
       to be a driver! I mean, if
       he or she wants to race
       and I see the potential
       then I would go for it..
       But you shouldn't push
       them into something. They
       need to come to you.
       Otherwise it's not going
       to work
   3. Hulkenberg set to
       sign for Audi
   4. Red Bull Racing on X
   5. [Will Buxton] A huge
       deal for Ferrari, with my
       understanding that its
       financial value will cover
       2/3 (66%) of the budget
       cap per annum. A massive
       partnership. Seeing that
       logo brings back some
       great early 2000s F1
       memories. Would love to
       see it inspire some NART
       style blue and white
       liveries for…

# Formula1
   1. Ayao Komatsu: Once
       we got the penalty for
       Kevin, there was no way
       to get the points, so we
       made the gap to ensure
       that Nico could get the
       points. A good team
       effort. We are just
       fighting for P10, and
       there are eight drivers
       going for it, so it's
       like a win for the team.

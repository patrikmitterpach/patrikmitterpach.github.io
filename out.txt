	The single most
     remarkable and defining
     moment of the past 500 years
     came at 05:29:45 on 16 July
     1945. At that precise
     second, American scientists
     detonated the first atomic
     bomb at Alamogordo, New
     Mexico. From that point
     onward, humankind had the
     capability not only to
     change the course of
     history, but to end it.

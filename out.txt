	In this course of life
     there await you many good
     things, such as love and
     practice of the virtues,
     forgetfulness of passions,
     knowledge of how to live and
     die, deep repose. The
     position of all busy men is
     unhappy, but most unhappy of
     all is that of those who do
     not even labour at their own
     affairs, but have to
     regulate their rest by
     another man’s sleep, their
     walk by another man’s pace,
     and whose very love and
     hate, the freest things in
     the world, are at another’s
     bidding. If such men wish to
     know how short their lives
     are, let them think how
     small a fraction of them is
     their own.
                        ~ Seneca

   1. [Philip Duncan]
       Verstappen was asked if
       his father regretted his
       comments: “I have not
       asked him that, but my
       dad is very outspoken
       and he is not a liar,
       that is for sure. My dad
       and I are very close. We
       call every day. I don’t
       see myself in F1 without
       them (his father and
       manager) by my side.”

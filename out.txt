# Formula1
   1. [Silverstone] TEN.
       MORE. YEARS. We're
       delighted to announce
       Silverstone will remain
       on the F1 calendar until
       at least 2034!
   2. [F1-Insider] The
       two friends' (Horner and
       Newey) contracts were
       once linked to one
       another. But according
       to information from
       F1-Insider.com, the bond
       of friendship has now
       broken. Newey has
       already told Red Bull
       that he will remain
       loyal to the world
       champion team even
       without Horner.
   3. Red Bull has
       actually made Albon an
       offer. However, this is
       not about a three-year
       contract that is ready
       to be signed in order to
       replace Sergio Perez
       from 2025. Red Bull just
       wants to secure an
       option, a kind of right
       of first refusal, on
       Albon's services [for
       2026].

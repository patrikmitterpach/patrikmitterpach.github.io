	‘I have no more fixed
     principle than that of not
     altering the course of my
     life to suit your
     prejudices: you may pour
     your accustomed talk upon me
     from all sides: I shall not
     think that you are abusing
     me, but that you are merely
     wailing like poor little
     babies.’
                        ~ Seneca

       “We’re trying to say
       ‘We’ll do whatever you ask
       of us. We’ll do whatever
       is there. Now, if you
       think of something, you
       tell us,’. But they
       haven’t told us yet except
       for some excuses like, ‘Oh
       we don’t want you coming
       on, we don’t want you to
       be embarrassed.’

       Hamilton says to Sky he
       made "massive changes" to
       the car setup to
       experiment after the
       sprint. Hamilton: "I’ll
       give it my best shot. 18th
       is pretty bad. When I was
       making the setup changes,
       I was like, it can’t get
       any worse, surely, and it
       did! Shit happens."

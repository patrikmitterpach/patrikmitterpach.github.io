Riches, I say, are not a
     good thing; for if they
     were, they would make men
     good.

    5. [Motorsport] Vowles on
       Sargeant: "He's reached
       the limit of what he's
       able to achieve & in fact
       it's almost unfair on him
       continuing that."
    6. Piastri surprised by
       Sargeant’s F1 struggles:
       “His potential was much
       greater”
    7. [Motosport.com] Vowles:
       "Mick isn't special, he
       would just be good. I
       think he would come with a
       lot more experience than
       Franco does. But the
       future of Williams isn't
       investing in the past."

       says that pesos played no
       part in choosing Franco
       Colapinto - but the
       decision is now paying
       off: "The phone is still
       ringing off the hook. A
       number of Argentine
       companies, of which there
       are many, are calling, and
       they're paying market rate
       for stickers on the car."

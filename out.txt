	The man that does good
     service to the State is not
     only he who brings forward
     candidates for public
     office, defends accused
     persons, and gives his vote
     on questions of peace and
     war, but he who encourages
     young men in well-doing, who
     supplies the present dearth
     of good teachers by
     instilling into their minds
     the principles of virtue,
     who seizes and holds back
     those who are rushing wildly
     in pursuit of riches and
     luxury, and, if he does
     nothing else, at least
     checks their course—such a
     man does service to the
     public though in a private
     station.

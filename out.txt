	Let us now pass on to
     the consideration of
     property, that most fertile
     source of human sorrows: for
     if you compare all the other
     ills from which we
     suffer—deaths, sicknesses,
     fears, regrets, endurance of
     pains and labours—with those
     miseries which our money
     inflicts upon us, the latter
     will far outweigh all the
     others. Reflect, then, how
     much less a grief it is
     never to have had any money
     than to have lost i(1).

   3. [Mark Hughes] (In
       response to a baseless
       rumor that Hamilton,
       Leclerc, and Alonso all
       avoided Verstappen)
       That’s just plain
       untrue. Neither Leclerc,
       Hamilton nor Alonso were
       offered a place.
       Hamilton and Alonso both
       tried and were told no.
   4. [Mark Hughes] (In
       response to the rumor
       about Alonso avoiding
       Verstappen) No. Because
       Alonso wasn’t offered
       the drive. Norris was.
       There is no place for
       Alonso at Red Bull with
       Max there.

when his last day arrives,
     the wise man will not hang
     back, but will walk with a
     steady step to meet death.

    6. F1 standings if using an
       Olympic-style table. The
       main difference is for
       Hamilton due to his two
       wins. I looked back to
       past years and most of the
       time it didn't affect
       Driver's champion. Since
       2000, only 2008(Massa
       instead of Hamilton) and
       2016(Hamilton instead of
       Rosberg) have changed.

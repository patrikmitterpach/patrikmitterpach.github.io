	Then, before I knew it,
     two things happened. One:
     the young South African Jody
     Scheckter, who had just
     started driving for the
     McLaren team, lost control
     of his car in the quick
     Woodcote corner, causing a
     huge pile-up. It was one of
     the biggest crashes there
     had ever been in Formula
     One, and it happened right
     before my very eyes. And
     two: I dropped my burger
     from the shock of it.
                  ~ Adrian Newey

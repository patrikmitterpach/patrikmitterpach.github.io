	I have heard or
     observed, the principal
     object is, not that mankind
     may be well and honestly
     clad, but, unquestionably,
     that corporations may be
     enriched.
           ~ Henry David Thoreau

       post-China GP: "The main

       it's too bad for us as
       drivers, I don't think we
       can be the ones to
       complain at all. It's not
       healthy for them, it is

	Let us believe nothing
     unless it forces itself upon
     our sight and is
     unmistakable, and let us
     reprove ourselves for being
     too ready to believe, as
     often as our suspicions
     prove to.

# Formula1
   1. Regarding Stroll's
       claim that everyone in
       front of him suddenly
       braked, he [Piastri] says
       meaningfully: "Yes, but
       everyone else didn't crash
       into each other."
       [MotorsportTotal]
   2. "I was just told now
       apparently he [Lance] was
       blaming me for it and if
       that's true - I was
       starting to calm down but
       that really pisses me off.
       I watched his onboard and
       as soon as we start to
       brake he starts looking at
       the corner...he's not even
       looking at me." [Daniel
       postrace on Viaplay]

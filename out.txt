	Those men whom you
     regard as fortunate, if you
     could see, not their outward
     show, but their hidden life,
     are really unhappy, mean,
     and base, ornamented on the
     outside like the walls of
     their houses: that good
     fortune of theirs is not
     sound and genuine: it is
     only a veneer, and that a
     thin one.
                        ~ Seneca

       Karun Chandhok on Carlos
       Sainz: “I don’t think
       Carlos wants to go to
       Audi. By the time he
       gets a contender in
       2029, he’ll be 38.”
       “This is his prime. If I
       was his manager, I would
       be sending Toto Wolff
       every metric and
       spreadsheet of why
       Carlos is equal to
       Charles Leclerc.”

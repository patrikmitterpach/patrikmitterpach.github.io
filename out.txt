How far more endurable what
     I have feared seems to be
     than what I have lusted
     after.

# Formula1
    1. Williams Team Principal
       James Vowles talking to
       DAZN about Carlos Sainz,
       "It was shockingly close
       to dating. It started with
       messages and it ended with
       my going to his hotel
       room."
    2. [Decalspotters] First
       official look at Ferrari's
       team kit for the Italian
       GP
    3. Christian Horner : I mean,
       we were winning races by
       20, 25 seconds and Stefano
       [Domenicali, F1 CEO] was
       asking us to slow down in
       the first five races. It
       can change very quickly,
       no need to Panic
    4. Money arrived to Russians:
       F1 team Haas may leave the
       Netherlands
    5. [@MercedesAMGF1] Exciting
       news! Kimi Antonelli will
       be making his FP1 debut at
       Monza this weekend. He’ll
       be driving George’s W15 in
       front of his home crowd
    6. Buxton: What I like about
       Oscar is he’s still new to
       all of this so he’s not
       trying to play up to a
       preconception of who he
       needs to be. Like George
       is trying to be this weird
       talented Mr Ripley type
       person. [...] Daniel is
       still trying to play up to
       being like the 24,
       25-year-old Daniel.
    7. Vettel backs Schumacher
       for F1 comeback with
       Williams
    8. Max Verstappen has the
       second longest winning
       slump after 7 wins in a
       season in F1 history. If
       he loses this week he will
       tie for first.
    9. [Thomas Maher] No
       decisions made yet
       regarding a possible
       Williams change for this
       weekend but wind is
       blowing against a Lawson
       switch as Red Bull wish to
       be able to pull him back
       if needed. Vowles
       understood to not be on
       board with this, meaning
       Schumacher more likely.
    10. [Chris Medland] Haas
       trucks are finally on the
       move to Monza after
       waiting overnight in the
       Netherlands. Former title
       sponsor Uralkali has
       confirmed receipt of last
       Friday’s payment that was
       due back to it, so the
       Haas trucks will make
       their way immediately to
       Italy

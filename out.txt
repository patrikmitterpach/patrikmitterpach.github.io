       Karun Chandhok on Carlos
       Sainz: “I don’t think
       Carlos wants to go to
       Audi. By the time he
       gets a contender in
       2029, he’ll be 38.”
       “This is his prime. If I
       was his manager, I would
       be sending Toto Wolff
       every metric and
       spreadsheet of why
       Carlos is equal to
       Charles Leclerc.”

       Lakshmikanthan] (RB
       engineer) I believed in
       him (Horner)! It’s hard
       to see him at debrief
       yesterday. The pain in
       his eyes and the damage
       has been done already!
       But super happy that the
       whole factory cheered
       and applauded for him
       when he said he’ll
       bounce back!

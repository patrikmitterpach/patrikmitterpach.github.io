	Let us now pass on to
     the consideration of
     property, that most fertile
     source of human sorrows: for
     if you compare all the other
     ills from which we
     suffer—deaths, sicknesses,
     fears, regrets, endurance of
     pains and labours—with those
     miseries which our money
     inflicts upon us, the latter
     will far outweigh all the
     others. Reflect, then, how
     much less a grief it is
     never to have had any money
     than to have lost it.

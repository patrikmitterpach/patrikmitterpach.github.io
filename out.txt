“Why, if the wise man
     receives neither injury nor
     insult, he punishes those
     who do these things?” He
     does not revenge himself,
     but corrects them.
                        ~ Seneca

    6. [Adam Cooper] James Vowles
       says that pesos played no
       part in choosing Franco
       Colapinto - but the
       decision is now paying
       off: "The phone is still
       ringing off the hook. A
       number of Argentine
       companies, of which there
       are many, are calling, and
       they're paying market rate
       for stickers on the car."

    9. [Motosport.com] Vowles:
       "Mick isn't special, he
       would just be good. I
       think he would come with a
       lot more experience than
       Franco does. But the
       future of Williams isn't
       investing in the past."
    10. [Julianne Cerasoli]
       Antonelli did not give the
       interview scheduled for
       after the second F1 free
       practice session because
       he went to the hotel
       early, as he was not
       feeling 100%. The impact
       was 45G, according to Toto
       Wolff. After the crash, he
       was 6th in the F2
       qualifying.

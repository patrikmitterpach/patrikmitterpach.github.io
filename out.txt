Friday, April 19

	It is unpleasant,
     burdensome, and covers one
     with shame to have to say,
     “Give me.” You should spare
     your friends, and those whom
     you wish to make your
     friends, from having to do
     this; however quick he may
     be, a man gives too late who
     gives what he has been asked
     for.
                        ~ Seneca

	Should Nature recall
     what she previously
     entrusted us with, let us
     say to her also: ‘Take back
     my spirit, which is better
     than when you gave it me: I
     do not shuffle or hang back.
     Of my own free will I am
     ready to return what you
     gave me before I could
     think: take me away.’
                        ~ Seneca

       these EL PLAN pictures on
       Alonso's 2021 Alpine and
       have been wondering since
       i first saw it, was it
       actually real? I only
       started watching F1 in
       2022 and wasnt around to
       actually see if it was
       real, if it is fake. Darn
       good job to the editors
       since the "editing" is
       splendid.

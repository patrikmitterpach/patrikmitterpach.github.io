Tuesday, June 18

	Near the end of March,
     1845, I borrowed an axe and
     went down to the woods by
     Walden Pond, nearest to
     where I intended to build my
     house, and began to cut down
     some tall, arrowy white
     pines, still in their youth,
     for timber.
           ~ Henry David Thoreau

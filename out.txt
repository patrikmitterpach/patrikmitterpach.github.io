	He who fears death will
     never act as becomes a
     living man: but he who knows
     that this fate was laid upon
     him as soon as he was
     conceived will live
     according to it, and by this
     strength of mind will gain
     this further advantage, that
     nothing can befall him
     unexpectedl(1).

# Formula1
   1. [Daniel Moxon]
       Reports this morning that
       Carlos Sainz is out of the
       running for the Mercedes
       seat. He’s highly unlikely
       to get a Red Bull deal
       either, so maybe it’s time
       for him to finally pull
       the trigger on that Audi
       deal? In any case, we
       could get a resolution
       soon!
   2. [Luke Smith] Drivers

   4. Mario Andretti:

   5. "Mercedes is no
       longer interested in
       signing Adrian Newey...
       Apparently, James was
       willing to tender his
       resignation, which was
       also rejected by the top
       management of the company,
       and the future must come
       through Allison's
       experience."

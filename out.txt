	Should Nature recall
     what she previously
     entrusted us with, let us
     say to her also: ‘Take back
     my spirit, which is better
     than when you gave it me: I
     do not shuffle or hang back.
     Of my own free will I am
     ready to return what you
     gave me before I could
     think: take me away.’
                        ~ Seneca

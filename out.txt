	It is unpleasant,
     burdensome, and covers one
     with shame to have to say,
     “Give me.” You should spare
     your friends, and those whom
     you wish to make your
     friends, from having to do
     this; however quick he may
     be, a man gives too late who
     gives what he has been asked
     fo(1).

# Formula1
   1. Bearman's Headrest
       at the End of Race
   2. Ayao Komatsu: Once
       we got the penalty for
       Kevin, there was no way
       to get the points, so we
       made the gap to ensure
       that Nico could get the
       points. A good team
       effort. We are just
       fighting for P10, and
       there are eight drivers
       going for it, so it's
       like a win for the team.

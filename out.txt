	Near the end of March,
     1845, I borrowed an axe and
     went down to the woods by
     Walden Pond, nearest to
     where I intended to build my
     house, and began to cut down
     some tall, arrowy white
     pines, still in their youth,
     for timber.
           ~ Henry David Thoreau

       and I now are going to go

   5. Pierre Gasly: "I was

       really unnecessary. I'm
       sad, disappointed with the
       situation. We definitely
       need to talk because we
       can't afford it,
       especially in a season
       like this. At that time we
       were P9 and P10, so there
       was absolutely no reason
       to risk taking out the two
       cars."

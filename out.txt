   1. Chinese GP trophy
   2. [The Race] "To reach
       100% of the potential of
       the car, sometimes I'm not
       able to do [that] without
       the help from my
       team-mate." Fernando
       Alonso says Lance Stroll's
       feedback is "crucial" for
       Aston's development
       because Alonso himself
       sometimes tends to just
       "drive around" any car
       problems.

       short notice.

       Hamilton: “I don’t feel

       old, I feel really young

       [George] got more problems
       physically than I do
       today.”
